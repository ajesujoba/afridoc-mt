The Social Impact of Sports Betting in Kenya: What Does the Future Hold? In contemporary Kenyan society, sports betting has become pervasive, leaving a notable imprint on the societal fabric. Betting with Bets Best has surfaced to guide enthusiasts navigating this flourishing sector. While this phase of growth and modernization brings economic prospects, it also ignites vital discussions about the social implications of this phenomenon. This article explores the multifaceted social sports betting in Kenya, attempting to paint a comprehensive picture of the current scenario and the future. The Current Landscape In the past decade, the sports betting industry in Kenya has witnessed exponential growth. This industry has not only become a considerable revenue generator but has also created employment opportunities for many. The demographic participating in sports betting is diverse, encompassing individuals from various age groups, genders, and geographical settings. However, the rapid proliferation of betting platforms, both online and offline, necessitates a closer look at the social implications. Detecting positive and negative repercussions is essential to carve a sustainable path forward. In doing so, an analysis of the role of government and regulatory bodies in shaping the future trajectory of this industry becomes imperative. Positive Social Impacts Community Engagement Sports betting in Kenya has fostered communal bonds and engagements. Friends, family, and even communities come together to watch games and engage in betting activities. Many betting firms have also undertaken community development initiatives, providing infrastructural and financial support to various projects fostering community and cooperation. Moreover, platforms like “Betting with Bets " contribute to educating the masses about the nuances of responsible betting, ensuring that enthusiasts are well-informed and can make sound betting decisions. Education and Awareness In parallel, there has been a surge in education and awareness programs concerning responsible gambling. These initiatives aim to instill a sense of moderation and restraint, highlighting the importance of not letting betting become a detrimental aspect of one's life. Workshoone seminars offering insights into the intricacies of sports betting have become common, helping to foster an informed betting community. Negative Social Impacts Gambling Addiction Despite the measures to promote responsible gambling, addiction remains a substantial concern. Stories of individuals losing substantial amounts, succumbing to debts, and facing severe mental health issues are familiar. This addiction poses a significant threat to the fabric of the family and society, as individuals find themselves trapped in a cycle of constant betting, chasing losses, and facing financial ruin. Economic Disparities The betting industry has exacerbated existing economic disparities in Kenya. With dreams of winning big, many individuals often stake a significant portion of their earnings, only to face substantial losses. This situation creates a widening gap between the economic classes, fostering resentment and social discord. Impact on Youth The youth demographic has not remained untouched. The allure of quick money has drawn many young individuals into betting. A genuine concern exists that this could influence them negatively, steering them away from education and more constructive pursuits. The challenge is to find a balance where the youth can enjoy sports betting recreationally without falling prey to its potential pitfalls. The Government and Regulatory Response The Kenyan government has regulated the industry more stringently in response to these challenges. Measures have been implemented to curb underage betting, and programs have been initiated to address gambling addiction at the community level. However, the effectiveness of these policies is still under scrutiny, and further refinement may be necessary to achieve the desired results. Future Projections As we gaze into the future, it becomes apparent that the industry is poised for further growth. However, this growth needs to be matched with robust regulatory frameworks that protect the vulnerable segments of society. Experts opine that multi-faceted multifaceted community initiatives, governmental policies, and self-regulation by betting firms can carve a sustainable path forward. Case Studies In dissecting the social impacts, it becomes vital to delve deep into real-life cases that embody both the positive and negative facets of sports betting in Kenya. These case studies will be explored in detail and will offer a window into the lives affected, offering lessons and insights to guide future policies and initiatives. Conclusion Kenya's sports betting landscape is a complex tapestry of economic opportunities coupled with social challenges. As the industry evolves, stakeholders, including the government, community leaders, and betting firms, must collaborate to foster a healthy betting environment. Through platforms like Betting with Bets Best, individuals can be guided to engage in responsible betting, preserving the positive aspects while mitigating the negatives.
Safaricom to appear in court for copyright infringement Ladies and gentlemen, the weekend. I can now rest and watch some movies and TV series this weekend. Last week, someone recommended a few sports documentaries, but I haven’t watched any. You need not worry, I will have time this weekend. Okay, enough about me. Reader, what plans do you have for the weekend? However you intend to spend it, please rest and have fun. Like me, if you haven’t left your house this week, I encourage you to do so. I know it’s not salary week yet, but you can visit your loved ones and soak up every moment you can with them. Here's what I've got for you today: Safaricom to appear in court for copyright infringement CBN launches online portal for microfinance banks Lupiya receives $8.25m Series A Safaricom to appear in court for copyright infringement Safaricom has failed to stop an alleged intellectual property infringement hearing. Here’s the backstory: In March 2021, a Kenyan businessman, Peter Nthei Muoki, said he approached representatives of Safaricom to discuss his idea. But he soon learnt that implementing it would be challenging. However, in 2022, he said the telco intended to introduce the "Manage Child Account" product via a USSD code. He stated that the product is comparable to his "M-Teen Account," an M-PESA sub-wallet for people aged 13 to 17 and 18 to 24, also known as Generation Z, to help parents better monitor their children's spending habits. Thus, he filed a lawsuit against Safaricom and Huawei Technologies (Kenya) after becoming aware of the copyright infringement. He also asked the court to order the telco to pay him royalties and licensing fees or Safaricom to pay him KSh10 billion ($67.8m) for the product. Further, Safaricom requested that the case hearing, scheduled for October 31, 2023, be postponed pending the outcome of the telco's appeal of an order. What's the order? It requires the telco to produce a list of documents, including a letter to Huawei Technologies (Kenya) Company Limited outlining a proposal for a solution to the parent-child control product functionality on the M-PESA platform. Safaricom objected to the application, claiming Muoki sought confidential information about CBK approval for a critical payment system that the telco runs for M-PESA. Back to the beginning: Judge Josephine Mong'are of a high court in Kenya has rejected Safaricom's request because “the application by the defendant has no merit and is hereby dismissed with costs to the Plaintiff.” CBN launches online portal for microfinance banks The Central Bank of Nigeria has launched a new online application platform, the CBN Licensing, Approvals and Other Requests Portal (CBN LARP), for microfinance bank (MFB) licence requests. Why? The apex bank said the portal will increase accessibility, reduce paperwork, and speed up licence approvals. Before now, prospective applicants for MFB licences physically submitted their applications to the CBN. But this platform will replace the manual process. Thus, starting September 25, 2023, those applying for MFB licences must run parallel applications in hard copy and online (via the CBN LARP). The parallel run will end on December 31, 2023, ending the manual submission of paper MFB licence applications. What's more, the apex bank stated it would extend the platform to additional licence categories. But it also noted it would still accept manual applications for all other licence types until further notice. Lupiya embraces $8.25m Series A Zambian fintech startup Lupiya has disclosed $8.25 million in Series A funding to enter new markets. Alitheia IDF Fund led the round, while INOKS Capital S.A. and German Investment Bank KfW DEG participated. Founded in 2016 by Evelyn Chilomo Kaingu (CEO) and Muchu Kaingu (CTO), Lupiya is an online marketplace offering microloans to people and businesses in Zambia. Lupiya distinguishes itself from traditional lenders by being accessible to underserved and unbanked communities and providing transparent and fair lending practices. The company plans to use the funds to improve its technological infrastructure, broaden its range of financial products, and expand its operations.

Here's what I've got for you today: MultiChoice loses $1.7b in six months Complete Farmer's $10.4m pre-Series A Kenya's Turaco acquires MicroEnsure Ghana MultiChoice lost $1.7b in six months MultiChoice investors lose R32 billion ($1.7 billion) in six months as it struggles to retain high-end subscribers and find new revenue sources. At the start of March 2023, MultiChoice's share price exceeded R147 ($7.86). On March 13, when it issued a warning that the revenue growth in its South African business would fall short of expectations, it decreased to about R120 ($6.41) per share. Due to its fixed cost base and additional Showmax expenses, it had a significantly lower trading margin. At that point, a six-month decline that cost the market cap billions of dollars started. One of MultiChoice's biggest problems is the continued cancellation of South Africans' DStv subscriptions, particularly in the Premium and Mid-market segments. The impact can be seen in DStv's average revenue per user, which dropped from R269 ($14.38) to R256 ($13.69) year over year. What’s the way forward? The company is looking for new revenue streams to offset the decline in high-end subscribers. This plan includes selling Internet packages, investing billions in its Showmax streaming service, and acquiring a large stake in sports betting service KingMakers. Complete Farmer's $10.4m pre-Series A What’s the news? Complete Farmer, a Ghanaian agritech startup, has announced that it has obtained a $10.4 million pre-Series A funding round — $7m in equity and $3.4m in debt — to streamline its operations. Who are the investors? The Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund (ARAF) and Alitheia Capital (via its uMunthu II Fund in partnership with Goodwell Investments) co-led the equity part of the round. Proparco, Newton Partners, and VestedWorld Rising Star Fund also took part. Sahel Capital’s SEFAA (Social Enterprise Fund for Agriculture in Africa) Fund, Alpha Mundi Group’s Alpha Jiri Investment Fund, and Global Social Impact Investments offered debt financing. What does Complete Farmer do? The startup, founded in 2017 by Desmond Koney (CEO), aims to revolutionise African farming practices by developing the necessary physical and technical infrastructure to boost efficiency along the entire agriculture value chain. It’s an end-to-end agricultural marketplace that connects farmers in Africa and other parts of the world to competitive markets, resources, and data. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the company operated as a contractor, cultivating farms for clients. After that, it switched to a marketplace and aggregator model. Growth? Following the pivot in 2021, the startup maintained that growth in userbase and revenue was immediate. It reported that it successfully brought together over 12,000 farmers from five significant regions in Ghana. It has also managed the farming of over 30,000 acres of land, providing commodities to Asia, Europe, and other regions across the globe while lowering post-harvest losses. By the end of 2021, it was generating $2.8 million annually. By 2022 ending, it had $5.3 million, and it is currently on track to hit $7.5 million this year. Kenya's Turaco acquires MicroEnsure Ghana Kenyan insurtech startup Turaco has acquired MicroEnsure Ghana from MIC Global, a US-based micro-insurance provider. As part of the agreement, MicroEnsure will change its name to Turaco Ghana while retaining its current team and management. With the addition of Ghana, Turaco's operational markets now total four, up from Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, and active policies by 25%. Current and potential customers will benefit from improved tech-driven processes by speeding up service delivery and reducing the turnaround time for claim payouts. Due to this acquisition, Turaco will also have the chance to strengthen relationships with current business partners and create a strategic reinsurance partnership with MIC Global. Launched in 2019, Turaco uses technology to increase access to affordable insurance. Its B2B2C business model relies on partnerships with tech-enabled, mass-market companies such as telcos, banks, and fintechs to provide simple distribution and insurance management. MicroEnsure (now Turaco Ghana) served three million customers as Ghana's first microinsurance intermediary, providing insurance for people with low incomes and being the first to introduce mobile insurance through Tigo in 2012 and Airtel in 2013. “We are excited about the opportunity of building on the 15-year legacy of MicroEnsure and leveraging our customer-centric tech solution to provide affordable and accessible cover,” said Ted Pantone, Co-founder and CEO of Turaco.

Complete Farmer, a Ghanaian agritech startup, gets $10.4 million pre-Series A to streamline operations Complete Farmer, a Ghanaian agritech startup, has announced that it has obtained a $10.4 million pre-Series A funding round — $7m in equity and $3.4m in debt — to streamline its operations. The Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund (ARAF) and Alitheia Capital (via its uMunthu II Fund in partnership with Goodwell Investments) co-led the equity part of the round. Proparco, Newton Partners, and VestedWorld Rising Star Fund also took part. Sahel Capital’s SEFAA (Social Enterprise Fund for Agriculture in Africa) Fund, Alpha Mundi Group’s Alpha Jiri Investment Fund and Global Social Impact Investments offered debt financing. The startup, founded in 2017 by Desmond Koney (CEO), aims to revolutionise African farming practices by developing the necessary physical and technical infrastructure to boost efficiency along the entire value chain of agriculture. Complete Farmer claims it’s an end-to-end agricultural marketplace that connects farmers in Africa and other parts of the world to competitive markets, resources, and data. This platform is a one-stop resource that uses exclusive cultivation protocols for crop production, allowing smallholder and commercial farmers to grow goods that meet the requirements of the global market and ensuring post-harvest offtake. The agritech has undergone several iterations since its launch before reaching its present state. The business started out working as a contractor to cultivate farms for customers. It continued to implement its solution until the COVID-19 pandemic. Incorporating its prior experience as a contractor and receiving crowdfunding, it transitioned to a marketplace and aggregator model. Koney says Complete Farmer found a way to supply customers with the necessary crops via its connections to thousands of farmers from earlier platform iterations. Complete Farmer's primary services to agricultural commodity suppliers and consumers are CF Grower and CF Buyer. Its farmer-focused product, CF Grower, enables African farmers to maximise their productivity, access global markets, and raise their living standards through data-driven cultivation protocols and precision farming tools. Meanwhile, CF Buyer offers dependable and practical access to commodities grown to customers' specifications to buyers globally. It gives buyers complete control over their procurement process by providing them access to a sizable network of qualified producers, a streamlined digital process for obtaining quality-certified goods, and a transparent way to track the status of their orders from order to fulfilment. Following the pivot in 2021, the startup maintained that growth in userbase and revenue was immediate. It reported that it has successfully brought together over 12,000 farmers from five significant regions in Ghana. It has also managed the farming of more than 30,000 acres of land, providing commodities to Asia, Europe, and other regions across the globe while lowering post-harvest losses. Complete Farmer was making $2.8 million yearly by the end of 2021 after deducting a 30% commission from the earnings from each farmer-to-buyer transaction. Koney claims it had $5.3 million at the end of 2022 and is on track to reach $7.5 million this year.
Uber and Bolt drivers protest in Gauteng The Director General of the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), Ezra Chiloba, has been suspended. Even though the reasons for his suspension are unknown, the former acting CEO of the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB), Christopher Wambua, has assumed his role in acting capacity. Chiloba, who assumed the DG role on September 28, 2021, for a four-year renewable term, succeeded Francis Wangusi, whose tenure ended in August 2019. Before that, he was a Principal Partner at Chil & Kemp Strategies Ltd, a strategy management company, where he focused on leadership and management effectiveness, policy and regulatory analysis, and strategy and risk management. From 2015 to 2018, Chiloba worked for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as its chief executive officer/commission secretary. Here's what I've got for you today: Zimbabwe receives Starlink's licence application Uber and Bolt drivers protest in Gauteng, South Africa ANKA gets $5 million Zimbabwe receives Starlink's licence application Zimbabwe has received Starlink's application for an operating licence, and the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) is reviewing it. The country's Minister of Information, Publicity, and Broadcasting Services, Jenfan Muswere, announced this on Monday. He claimed that fibre connections alone won’t improve connectivity in Zimbabwe's more rural areas, but Starlink will. It’s not clear when Starlink will be available in Zimbabwe. While the company plans to launch operations in the Southern African country in Q4 2023, reports suggest that it is sending a revised date of Q2 2024 after receiving a preorder for the kit. Meanwhile, Mozambique, which this year became Zimbabwe's first neighbour to operate the service, has made it much simpler for Zimbabweans to obtain these kits. How? Zimbabweans have learnt they can register their kits in Mozambique and use them in Zimbabwe without having to pay for a roaming plan or deal with its limitations (60-day roaming access). This news comes two weeks after POTRAZ warned against the unlicensed use of Starlink. At the time, the country was experiencing an epidemic of reselling. Sidebar: South Africa implemented much stricter rules regarding the use of Starlink in August 2023. Until the company obtains the necessary licences to start providing the service, the importation, distribution, and use of Starlink services are prohibited in the country. Uber and Bolt drivers protest in Gauteng Ride-hailing drivers in Gauteng, South Africa, started a two-day "last-push protest" yesterday. They gathered in the Central Business District of Johannesburg before marching to the Premier's office, a government office in Johannesburg. The protest is in response to their complaints about the government's introduction of Bajaj Qute vehicles that use ride-hailing apps. Some backstory: Between July and August, Bolt and Uber announced partnerships with the Gauteng provincial government to provide Bajaj Qute vehicles, scooters, skill development, and other entrepreneurial support to couriers and drivers using their platforms. But these drivers are against this alliance because, in the words of Kenny Moretsele, a representative for the E-hailing Partners Council, "this is the same government that we have been pouring our hearts out to regarding our challenges in this industry, and now they have decided to enter into a partnership with the companies that have been exploiting us for years." Further, the launch of the Bajaj Qute vehicles creates a cheaper category of services, which could drive out existing players in the sector because it offers the lowest prices. Consequently, Uber and Bolt drivers went offline yesterday and will do so again today. What's more, while yesterday's march was aimed at speaking to the government about their complaints, the protesters will march today to the Uber and Bolt offices in Parktown North and Randburg, respectively. ANKA gets $5 million ANKA (formerly Afrikrea), an Ivorian SaaS eCommerce platform, has raised $5 million in a pre-Series A extension round that combines debt and equity. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) led the round, with Proparco and Bpifrance participating. The company plans to use the funds to expand its presence in top nations where it has already experienced unmatched growth, including Nigeria and Kenya for the number of sellers and the US for the number of customers and subscribers. ANKA considers itself an all-in-one SaaS for multinational African companies. However, it ran an online store (Afrikrea) for apparel, accessories, arts, and crafts with African roots and inspiration until 2021. Now, ANKA acts as a one-stop shop for three different user types: exporters looking to ship internationally, online retailers using multiple channels who want to combine all of their orders on one platform, and dropshippers looking to produce, ship, and create jobs in Africa while getting paid internationally. By 2030, ANKA hopes to onboard 100,000 African sellers with the help of this funding while using the debt component to cover short-term cash needs for things like shipping and payment float. In case you missed it Nigerian-led Mainstack emerges as one of the top 20 startups at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 Former CEO of 54Gene launches Syndicate Bio, another genomics company Nigerian blockchain company Convexity named one of Circle pitch event finalists at BlackRock HQ, New York What I'm reading and watching Elon Musk says Twitter, now X, could charge all users subscription fees TikTok introduces a way to label AI-generated content YouTube Demonetizes Russell Brand After Rape Allegations or watch a video here Russell Brand accused of rape, sexual assault and abusive behaviour Jordan Peterson calmly dismantles feminism infront of two feminists
Nigerian-led Mainstack emerges as one of the top 20 startups at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 Co-founded by Ayobami Oyaleke, US-based fintech startup, Mainstack has made it into the league of the top 20 startups out of the 200 global startups competing for $100 thousand in equity-free funding at the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield competition. A credible source told Techpoint Africa that the startup is the only Nigerian-led and possibly only African-founded startup that made it to the top 20 stage. Mainstack is a fintech platform that helps entrepreneurs and creators showcase and accept payments from a global audience. It is a no-code API platform that assists them in creating a storefront, generating invoices, and managing bookings. While the startup is US-based, it has a subsidiary in Nigeria. It raised an undisclosed pre-seed round in April 2023 and is currently raising a seed round. Techpoint Build PitchStorm winner Before founding Mainstack, Oyaleke founded Placements.ng, a startup that created internship opportunities for Nigerians. The startup went on to win Techpoint Build's maiden startup competition, PitchStorm, in 2018. Placements: The journey from FUTA to Washington DC Shortly after emerging as the first winner of PitchStorm, Oyaleke revealed that Placements had been shortlisted to participate in the Diaspora Demo Summit in Washington, DC, US. Although Placements.ng doesn't exist anymore given that the domain is now for sale, about 2,000 organisations used the platform to recruit 5,000 interns. Oyaleke has built four startups in the last 10 years, with two-year-old Mainstack — a Techstars 2023 New York alumni — being the latest. Other Nigerian-led startups at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 Although Mainstack is the only Nigerian-led startup that has made it to the final stage, TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 had a diverse array of Nigerian-led startups. Some of these startups include: Akowe Founded by Ayodeji Agboola in 2020, Akowe is a startup that wants to use the power of blockchain to digitise the issuance and verification of certificates in Nigeria. Agboola told Techpoint Africa in February 2023 that, "In Nigeria, academic records are still manual and are issued as physical documents. There are also physical processes that make it difficult to verify the authenticity of these records." Alusoft Technologies LTD Alusoft is an edtech platform that creates products focused on helping students, schools and parents. The company's product, EduPorch, makes it possible for parents, schools, and students to interact seamlessly. Bus54 Bus54 is a mobility startup that wants to revolutionise bus transportation in Africa. The startup wants to do four things — make booking buses easier, provide a software platform for transporters, and financing to ensure access to efficient buses. Famasi Africa Famasi Africa is a startup that uses a software platform to connect individuals and businesses to pharmacies.
Placements: The journey from FUTA to Washington DC You will recall that Placements.ng emerged winner of Pitch Storm at the inaugural edition of Techpoint Build. In what appears to be additional icing on the cake, no more than a week after, the internship opportunities startup was shortlisted to participate in the Diaspora Demo Summit in Washington DC. The week long, intensive, all-expense-paid programme is organised by Tip Hub in partnership with Amazon and Facebook. The idea for the programme is to have a community of African startups in diaspora, to foster growth, collaboration and networking. According to Placements CEO, Ayobami Oyaleke, of the many applications received, Placements is among only seven startups selected. For their involvement, they get to be mentored and also participate in scheduled visits to different talent accelerators in New York City and North Carolina during and after the programme. Before Techpoint Build, Placements in November 2017 got admitted into an accelerator programme (which they are still a part of) organised by the German government aimed at bringing together 30 startups in Africa engaged in social works. The programme is in partnership with other companies across Africa, including CcHub, its West Africa partner. It was in fact during the programme at CcHub that Placements got a good grip of their business model, something which actually helped the startup to focus on the key metrics during the Pitch Storm at Techpoint Build. However, there is no undermining the impact of Techpoint Build in their current wave of milestones. Ayobami Oyaleke, who landed in DC last night and spoke to Techpoint via a phone call placed at midnight, Washington DC time, says, “ Techpoint Build gave us something very valuable -- it gave us leverage. It may otherwise not have come that easily. Presently there's nothing we are looking for that we do not have. Maybe not $1 million but the Techpoint ₦1 million, along with the brand leverage has helped us positioned our business for the times ahead.” His managing partner, Tayo Fagbohun, who remains in Nigeria, equally acknowledges the impact of Techpoint Build. In hindsight, the story of Placements evokes memories of a humble beginning, one that many “now established” startups in the tech industry can relate with. From attempting to build recognisable tech companies early on from the university, from relatively obscure backgrounds, to finally making good on such bold ambitions, this has been the case for a few startups in Nigeria that have risen to prominence. In the case of Placements, this dream started from the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). Thereafter, they setup actual operations in Ibadan where they honed their entrepreneurial skills. Both cities are in the Southwestern part of Nigeria with seemingly less advanced technology communities compared to Lagos. While the story is different today, Placements would certainly not be judged by its background but by its milestones. We at Techpoint are glad to have played a part in their present -- and perhaps, future -- success.
Former CEO of 54Gene launches Syndicate Bio, another genomics company On Monday, Abasi Ene-Obong, former co-founder and CEO of 54gene, an African genomics startup, disclosed the launch of Syndicate Bio, another genomics company. Ene-Obong claimed that Syndicate Bio just came out of stealth to support inclusive advancements in global genomics. He maintained that the company will drive genomics and precision medicine initiatives in the most diverse parts of the world, starting with Africa. Jumi Popoola and Estelle Dogbo will be the Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Syndicate Bio, respectively. Wubrest T. Bekele, Wissam Hamou, and Aminu Yakubu will join them as company leaders. "We will be sharing some of the great strides made in furtherance of our vision and mission in the coming months," Ene-Obong said. Ene-Obong founded 54gene in 2019 to fill a void in the global genomics space, where less than 3% of the genetic material used in pharmaceutical research is African. What 54gene actually does and why you should care, as told by COO, Delali Attipoe Two months after 54Gene announced its initial round of layoffs in August 2022, Ene-Obong resigned as CEO. The layoffs affected 95 employees, the majority of whom were contractors hired to work in the COVID business line, which 54Gene launched in 2020. COVID-19 brought a surge in African healthtech innovation, but how viable are the startups now? While the company didn’t specify why he resigned, TechCrunch reported that a group of employees levelled allegations of financial impropriety — reportedly “unfounded” — against the founder and ex-CEO, Abasi Ene-Obong, and his executives. In October 2022, following his resignation, 54gene laid off 100 employees or 55% of its workforce.
ANKA plans to hire tech talent to fuel expansion plans with $5m pre-Series A extension round ANKA (formerly Afrikrea), an Ivorian SaaS eCommerce platform, has raised $5 million in a pre-Series A extension round that combines debt and equity. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) led the round, with Proparco and the French investment bank Bpifrance participating. By 2030, ANKA hopes to onboard 100,000 African sellers with the help of this funding while using the debt component to cover short-term cash needs for things like shipping and payment float. It will also use the funding to support its efforts in product development and service expansion to promote and further the growth of African entrepreneurship on a global scale. ANKA bills itself as an all-in-one SaaS for multinational African companies. However, it ran an online store (Afrikrea) for apparel, accessories, arts, and crafts with African roots and inspiration until 2021. At the time, TechCrunch reported it had assisted thousands of buyers from 170 countries and over 7,000 sellers from 47 African nations. Since its last capital infusion in January 2023, ANKA's margins and the community of African SMEs in these 47 countries have almost doubled. It claims it has received over 700,000 monthly visits and handled $35 million in transactions in 2016. According to Kadry Diallo, Co-Founder and COO, the figures have increased to over a million visits and $50 million across 175 nations, increasing revenue by 18 times, from €200,000 to €3.6 million. Moulaye Taboure (CEO) said the transition to a SaaS eCommerce platform was necessary to focus merchants' attention from various channels, such as websites and social media, onto a single platform. Because of this, ANKA acts as a one-stop shop for three different user types: exporters looking to ship internationally, online retailers using multiple channels who want to combine all of their orders on one platform and drop shippers looking to produce, ship, and create jobs in Africa while getting paid internationally. The new round of funding brings the company's total investment since its founding in 2016 to $13.5 million. The company plans to expand its presence in top nations where it has already experienced unmatched growth, including Nigeria and Kenya for the number of sellers and the US for the number of customers and subscribers. It also intends to actively hire sales, tech, and product talent with the investment to fuel its expansion.
Nigerian blockchain company Convexity named one of Circle pitch event finalists at BlackRock HQ, New York The news: Nigerian blockchain company Convexity is among the companies that will be pitching at the Circle's solutions pitch competition event. The event is an inaugural pitch competition by Circle that aims to showcase tools that enable rapid humanitarian aid or tackle one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Convexity will be pitching its humanitarian aid tool, CHATS, to judges from BlackRock, UN, and Circle for a $100 thousand investment. Nigerian blockchain solutions company Convexity will be pitching its humanitarian aid solution, CHATS, at the headquarters of a $10 trillion asset management firm, BlackRock, in New York, USA. CHATS, which stands for Convexity's humanitarian aid transfer solution, is a solution that helps NGOs track the disbursement of aid in Africa. Co-founder of Convexity, Adedeji Owonibii, and his team came up with CHATS after they discovered the number of fraudulent activities that impede aid distribution in Africa. Aid in Africa has been largely misappropriated. The continent has received $1.2 trillion in aid since 1960, however, these funds have had no visible impact on the continent. CHATS is currently backed by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and has received a grant from the UN body. On a call with Techpoint Africa, Uyoyo Ogedegbe, Convexity's Investment and Business Development Partner, said CHATS qualified for the pitch because it solves key problems Circle's solutions pitch competition event was looking out for. "The core themes we hit on were financial inclusion, transparency, technology, and aid distribution." CHATS aid distribution solution utilises blockchain technology to ensure transparency. Donors can track the disbursement of their donations from NGOs down to every aid beneficiary. Africa received $58.4bn aid in 2021, but Convexity's CHATS wants to track where these monies are going For the distribution of aid to individuals who aren't financially included, CHATS has options such as the SMS token option that enables beneficiaries to redeem their funds. Circle's solution pitch competition event Convexity is one of six companies that will be pitching their solution at Circle's solution pitch competition event. Other finalists in the competition include Lithuania-based Ebioro which focuses on the development of products and services that help people become financially independent. Similar to Convexity's CHATS, HesabPay's solution is geared towards tackling the UN's zero poverty SDG goal. It does this by sending aid payments directly to beneficiaries in hard-to-reach areas with a focus on traceability and speed. These companies will be pitching their solution to Judges such as Sunita Grote, Lead and UNICEF Ventures Co-founder, Robbie Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, and Circle's Chief Strategy and Policy Officer, Dante Disparte. While Ogedegbe is not certain if one (the winner) or all the companies will be receiving a $100 thousand investment, he points out that the competition is an opportunity to reach global investors.
Safaricom to collaborate with Apple 500,000 people are using 5G in Nigeria. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) shared this information with media executives over the weekend. Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, stated that this move has increased broadband penetration in the country. He asserted that broadband penetration stands at an estimated 47.01% as of July 2023. Sidebar: Remember when former ICT Minister Isa Pantami and ex-President Muhammadu Buhari declared that the Starlink deployment had resulted in 100% broadband penetration in Nigeria? You can always read Emmanuel's story to understand the concept of broadband penetration better here: No, Starlink has not given Nigeria 100% broadband penetration, despite what the president claims Here's what I've got for you today: Naspers' CEO steps down Roam launches a new shuttle bus model Safaricom to collaborate with Apple Naspers' CEO steps down Bob van Dijk stepped down from his positions as Chief Executive of Naspers and Head of Prosus NV yesterday. In a statement to shareholders, the boards of both companies “mutually agreed” on Van Dijk's resignation. Van Dijk will continue to work as a board consultant for Prosus and its parent company, Naspers, through the end of September 2024. Ervin Tu, Chief Investment Officer, will serve as the interim CEO, replacing Van Dijk, who has led Naspers since 2014 and Prosus since its IPO in 2019. Tu moved from SoftBank to Naspers and Prosus two years ago. In the past, he also held a position at Goldman Sachs Group, where he specialised in mergers and acquisitions. Per the official statement, Tu significantly contributed to the company's strategic direction as Chief Investment Officer and will maintain continuity in implementing the group's top priorities. Naspers is a South African Internet, technology, and multimedia holding company and one of the largest investors and operators in the world of technology with interests in online retail, publishing, and venture capital investment. In September 2019, Naspers spun off its international Internet businesses to create an eCommerce investor, Prosus NV, now Nasper’s majority owner. Roam launches a new shuttle bus model Roam (formerly Opibus), a Kenyan-based EV startup, has launched Move, a shuttle bus model. Roam intends to increase production of the Move bus and broaden its charging network in response to the rise in demand for EV buses. Launched in 2017 by Filip Gardler, Filip Lövström, and Mikael Gånge, Roam initially focused on auto conversions before transitioning to the production of electric vehicles. The Roam-designed 42-seater buses have a 200-kilometre range, 170 kWh battery pack, and cost $135,000. Locally assembled by Thika-based Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers (KVM) using parts from China, a 52-passenger capacity is also an option for the vehicle. The company will start delivering 50 buses that have been ordered by February 2024. At maximum output, it expects to produce 40 units per month. Roam Move comes after the company disclosed in 2021 that it would launch EV buses to supplement its motorcycle manufacturing business. It also follows the launch of Roam Rapid, an electric Mass Transit Bus designed to connect users to Kenya's (now-stalled) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, in July 2023. Another Kenyan electric mobility startup, BasiGo, already has tens of electric buses operating on essential routes. Sidebar: In 2022, Kenya announced it would only use electric vehicles on the BRT system. In April 2023, the government received $377.8 million (Sh50 billion) from a consortium of European agencies to build a Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) lane in Nairobi — the first electric bus lane in East Africa. It plans to ease the city's traffic congestion. Safaricom to collaborate with Apple Safaricom is collaborating with Apple to integrate M-PESA and its PayPal platform to expand M-PESA's global transactional reach. William Ruto, Kenya’s President, announced this last week at the US-African Business Roundtable. Safaricom and PayPal have an existing partnership that allows funds to be transferred between M-PESA and PayPal accounts. Customers can link their PayPal accounts to their M-PESA wallets, enabling them to purchase goods and services from vendors globally. Additionally, M-PESA users can still receive and withdraw cash from more than 140,000 agents in Kenya. Currently, M-PESA serves over 51 million users across seven nations. AliExpress and Western Union are two additional international partnerships that lets the Kenyan mobile money giant's users send and receive money anywhere in the world. President William Ruto also visited Silicon Valley in San Francisco to entice American tech investors and companies to invest in Kenya. He said, “Kenya is a full package investment destination; economically stable, entrepreneurial, secure, innovative with a favourable tax environment, skilled labour force, technological expertise, green energy credentials and a gateway for six undersea fibre-optic cables providing reliable data connectivity.” In case you missed it Backed by the Gates Foundation, i3 announces second cohort of healthcare supply chain startups Do you live in Nigeria?

Nestcoin gets $1.9m strategic funding to strengthen its balance sheet after a tough 2022 The news: Nestcoin has secured $1.9 million in strategic funding to strengthen its balance sheet and further the growth of its new product, Onboard. The funding round was led by Hashed Emergent, with participation from other investors. The startup, which raised $6.45 million in 2022, lost a significant part of it to the FTX crash in November 2022. Surviving FTX Nestcoin's $1.9 million in strategic funding comes after its $6.45 million pre-seed funding in February 2022. The funding, which was one of the largest pre-seed rounds on the continent, was unfortunately lost to the FTX crash of November 2022. Yele Bademosi, Co-founder and CEO of Nestcoin said in a statement that the company held a significant portion of its investment as stablecoin in the now-defunct crypto exchange, FTX. However, Nestcoin has since bounced back by focusing on one product — Onboard. The focus on Onboard is a pivot from Nestcoin's initial mission, an incubator; a company with several crypto products that also invested in other crypto/Web3 companies. How Nestcoin survived the FTX crash and pivoted to Onboard Onboard is a non-custodial crypto wallet with the benefits of a custodial wallet. Nestcoin's new funding will be used to further the growth of the platform and strengthen its balance sheet. The funding round was led by Hashed Emergent, with participation from other investors such as Adaverse, Base Ecosystem Fund, Alter Global, CMT Digital, Magic Fund, and 4DX Ventures. This strategic investment is coming when crypto/Web3 startups are reeling from a severe crypto winter that has seen numerous crypto companies shut down. However, Nestcoin told Techpoint Africa it has been able to pull off this funding despite the Web3/crypto climate. " We have a strong team with a successful history in Web3 and fintech. During the most difficult times, we showed we are resilient and relentlessly committed to our mission." Its mission for Onboard is to provide universal access to world-class financial services. "We firmly believe that access to high-quality financial services should be universally available, regardless of one's geographical location," Bademosi said. Onboard is taking on non-custodial giants like MetaMask, Phantom, and Trust Wallet. Its competitive advantage is making it easy for wallet holders to keep their wallets safe. While the likes of Trust Wallet require wallet holders to keep a 12-word seed phrase as the key to their wallets, Onboard is making it easy to access non-custodial wallets with a simple username and password. It is also easing on-ramp and off-ramp on its non-custodial wallet, eliminating the need to move funds from non-custodial wallets to crypto-exchanges to convert from crypto to fiat or vice versa. Crypto virtual cards Essentially, Onboard wants to simplify the use of crypto for the uninitiated, and its next milestone fits into this mission. The company said it plans to launch "Onboard Virtual Cards, a service that will allow Onboard users to spend their crypto as easily as cash, making both online and in-store payments possible across more than 160 countries." Onboard currently has over 10,000 users, according to Nestcoin, but with the ongoing crypto winter, Onboard needs users to see crypto beyond speculation; a dilemma facing the entire crypto ecosystem.
Africa received $58.4bn aid in 2021, but Convexity's CHATS wants to track where these monies are going Between 2010 and 2021, Africa received $607.7 billion in aid, with the highest ($58.4 billion) coming in 2021. Africa also gets the lion's share of global aid, with 30% coming to the continent annually. This article estimates that aid to the continent since 1960 has reached $1.2 trillion. However, there hasn't been a corresponding change in the living standards of Africans living on the continent; some even say aid is hurting Africa. Given the many instances of misappropriation of aid in Africa, it would be safe to say a significant portion of aid to the continent has been mismanaged. The aid embezzlement scandal in Uganda and the illegal $800 billion outflows from Africa are only two examples. This is why Adedeji Owonibi, COO and Co-founder of blockchain solutions company, Convexity, and his team, have developed CHATS — Convexity's humanitarian aid transfer solution — to track who gets what, when, and where. After consulting for international NGOs on fiscal forensics, Owonibi realised there were a lot of fraudulent activities going on when it came to aid distribution; this was when the idea for CHATS was buried in his mind. CHATS is a solution that addresses the issue of aid disbursement by tracking aid delivery from the donor to the NGO, field agents, and all the way down to the beneficiaries. Convexity CTO, Charles Okaformbah, said, "CHATS will help everybody be accountable to the donor, who will get a chance to see how their money is being used." How does CHATS work? CHATS is a suite of platforms with four sides — one each for the NGOs, donors, vendors, and beneficiaries. On a call with Techpoint Africa, Okaformbah explained how each platform worked, starting with the NGOs. NGO platform With CHATS, NGOs can create campaigns and see how beneficiaries are reaping the benefits of the campaigns in real time. Once a campaign is created on the platform, an NGO has the option to create a form. Field agents then populate the form with the details of targeted beneficiaries. The details include a government-recognised means of identification and biometric information. To make sure field agents are recording real people, Okaformbah added that the system is equipped with machine learning software that makes sure the photos taken are of living humans and not pictures. Once the NGO has the beneficiary's details, it can control the disbursement of money, palliatives, or any other form of aid from the NGO dashboard. The dashboard also allows donors and NGOs to customise the amount of aid each beneficiary gets based on their information. For example, the NGO can customise the system to pay out a different amount to single beneficiaries and those with families. There's also task-based aid which means the NGO could support people with aid after they've completed a task. The vendor's side of things Okaformbah described the vendors as those contracted or hired by an NGO to disburse aid to beneficiaries. He said the platform created for them is a way for them to "track and disburse payment." While the vendors have their platform, it is important that they are equipped with the right tools to confirm each beneficiary's claim. Per Okaformbah, CHATS gives NGOs an option to use an NFC card to disburse aid. However, NGOs must ensure vendors have NFC-ready devices. An NGO could also choose to let beneficiaries redeem their claims via the QR code option. This option requires the beneficiary to generate a QR code that will be scanned by the vendors. "The beneficiary is given this QR code by the NGO, so they can just print it out. Each QR code is unique to the beneficiary. When scanned, you can see the names of the beneficiary and the amount allotted to them." There's also the SMS token option. With this option, the NGO sends a token to the beneficiary via SMS, which they present to the vendor. The beneficiary's platform While registering beneficiaries for a campaign is done by field agents, beneficiaries can also register themselves. However, they will still need to be verified by an NGO after they have registered. "This is basically for those who are tech-inclined. The beneficiary can onboard themselves for a campaign, and what this does is reduce the beneficiary onboarding time." Okaformbah added that the beneficiary app also serves as a mobile wallet allowing them to receive monetary aid on the app and withdraw to their bank accounts or mobile money wallets. The blockchain side of things Blockchain is used to track the movement of aid and information on CHATS. The platform even accepts donations in cryptocurrencies. However, the team behind CHATS is more concerned with the simplicity and usefulness of the platform rather than highlighting the technology that makes it work. The NGOs' donors will also be getting a platform that will help them monitor their donations. However, it won't be available until the end of 2023. Okaformbah explained that they'll also have the option to withdraw their funds if they are dissatisfied with how the NGO is running the campaign. Convexity has already received pre-seed investment for CHATS from the UNICEF Venture Fund. Uyoyo Ogedegbe, Convexity's Investment and Business Development Partner, added that there has been a lot of investment interest in CHATS and a seed investment round for the platform is already underway. He said the platform is also being positioned to handle universal basic income (UBI) for Nigeria, an income system he believes Nigeria and many other countries could be adopting soon. However, only time will tell if CHATS can change the narrative around aid in Nigeria and make sure that those who need it get it.
Naspers CEO steps down; Ervin Tu, Chief Investment Officer, takes over in the interim Bob van Dijk, Chief Executive Officer of Prosus NV and Naspers, is leaving his positions as Chairman of the Board and as Head of the eCommerce investor. Van Dijk's resignation is effective today, September 18, 2023. He has been the Chief Executive of Naspers since 2014 and of Prosus since its IPO in 2019. Naspers is a South African Internet, technology, and multimedia holding company and one of the largest investors and operators in the world of technology with interests in online retail, publishing, and venture capital investment. Several industries, including edtech, food delivery, classified ads, social/gaming, payments and fintech, and social/gaming, have benefited from Naspers' investments. In September 2019, Naspers spun off its international Internet businesses to create Prosus NV, now Nasper’s majority owner. In a statement to shareholders, the boards of both companies “mutually agreed” on Van Dijk's resignation. “The Boards of Prosus and Naspers want to thank Bob for his leadership over a full decade,” said Koos Bekker, Chair of Prosus, in a statement. “During this time, substantial businesses were established in Classifieds, Food Delivery and Payments, while we also entered several new fields. We appreciate Bob’s contributions and wish him much success with his future career.” Van Dijk will continue to work as a board consultant for Prosus and its parent company, Naspers, through the end of September 2024. In the interim, Ervin Tu, Chief Investment Officer, will take over as Chief Executive Officer. Tu moved from SoftBank to Naspers and Prosus two years ago. In the past, he also held a position at Goldman Sachs Group, where he specialised in mergers and acquisitions. According to the statement, Tu significantly contributed to the company's strategic direction as chief investment officer and will maintain continuity in implementing the group's top priorities. “The boards of Prosus and Naspers want to thank Bob for his leadership over a full decade,” said Chairman Koos Bekker. “During this time, substantial businesses were established in classifieds, food delivery and payments, while we also entered several new fields.”
A partnership agreement is preventing LagosRide drivers from owning cars they've financed for four years After years of unemployment, Sola Nelson decided to become a LagosRide driver. But one month after getting his GAC SUV, Nelson decided to return the car. When I asked him why, he said, it was the biggest mistake he'd ever made. I spoke to several LagosRide drivers who feel the same way. A recurring theme in my conversations with them is "modern slavery." They feel they are slaves on the ride-hailing platform and call desperately for the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to come to their aid. Governor Sanwo-Olu launched LagosRide officially in March 2021 as a way to improve mobility and create a multi-modal transportation system for Lagosians. During the launch, Sanwo-Olu said, LagosRide is "one of the State Government’s socio-economic intervention programmes, which will be professionally managed in line with global best practices.” However, many drivers believe LagosRide's management is far from professional. LagosRide is run differently from other ride-hailing platforms like Bolt and Uber. If you live in Lagos, there's a good chance you have seen LagosRide-branded GAC SUVs and Saloons. Unlike Bolt and Uber, LagosRide uses a lease-to-own model where drivers get one of these cars after a ₦700,000 ($933) down payment. LagosRide's drivers' issue with the platform stems from its lease-to-own model. The down payment was initially ₦1.5 million ($2,000), 20% of ₦7.5 million ($10,000) — the total cost of the car — but according to Tumi Adeyemi, CEO of Zeno, LagosRide's technology service provider, the price was reduced to ₦700,000 after many interested drivers could not afford it. Even at ₦700,000, the down payment was still too high for many. This led LagosRide to employ a partnership scheme. Unfair partnerships? Like many drivers, the partnership scheme was the only way Nelson could have gotten a vehicle because he could not afford the down payment. The partnership arrangement is simple. A partner makes the ₦700,000 down payment on behalf of a driver. The driver works with the car, makes the ₦9,500 ($12.67) daily payments, buys fuel, and shares whatever is left with the partner, with the driver typically getting 60% and the partner getting 40%. The worrying part of this arrangement, however, is that after paying ₦9,500 every day for four years (₦10,368,000 [$14,038]), the driver still doesn't own the car. The car is owned by the partner whose only investment is a ₦700,000 down payment. "We have a ₦43,970 ($59.54) daily target to meet. From this target, we pay ₦9,500 for the car. We buy data and petrol, we make repairs, and still share money with partners. Sometimes I have to borrow money to make these payments. Then I wonder, what's really my gain," groaned a driver who pleaded anonymity. Nelson was in the same situation and decided to return the SUV he was given. He was already in a mountain of debt over a job that was supposed to feed him. But feeding wasn't his only worry. Many of the drivers I spoke to had families to support and meeting targets was hard. Being a relatively new platform, some drivers said it was difficult to get requests. The increase in petrol prices also didn't help matters. Nelson got his GAC SUV in May 2023. On his first day, he made ₦15,000 ($20.31) because he was still learning the ropes. But before he could hone his skills as a ride-hailing driver, the price of petrol rose to over ₦500 ($0.68) by the end of the month. "It was like war, but I was still pushing it, trying my best to meet my target, but things got too difficult." The signs were there "LagosRide started the scheme when many drivers were unable to afford the down payment," Adeyemi recalls, "We allowed partners and drivers to agree on a revenue-sharing formula, which we think should be fair." But it wasn't fair. "The biggest mistake I made was getting LagosRide through IOS," Nelson groaned. IOS Global Logistics Limited is a third-party logistics startup that connects vehicle owners to drivers. It also connects LagosRide partners with drivers. A driver connected to a partner through IOS sent me a copy of the IOS-Driver agreement. To get a LagosRide vehicle via IOS, interested drivers pay a non-refundable fee of ₦10,000 ($10.34) for the cost of driver nomination and a background check. The driver is entitled to "60% of daily sums net earnings (after deductions of all relevant expenses.) Whilst the company shall be entitled to 40% of daily net earnings to be remitted to the owner of the vehicle (after deductions of relevant expenses)." The agreement also states that the vehicle given to the driver will remain the property of the company (IOS) "or that of the owner to which the company serves as a manager." But why did the drivers sign an agreement that clearly says they will not own the cars after they complete payment? Desperation! Desperation that partners conveniently exploit. However, exploitation was not part of the plan when LagosRide created the partnership scheme. Adeyemi explained that LagosRide was only taking advantage of a similar existing arrangement between Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association of Nigeria (PEDPAN) and IOS. "That association already had a thriving community of partner-driver relationships coming from Uber and Bolt." This reassured LagosRide of fair partnerships between partners and drivers. Adeyemi, however, admitted that the partnership scheme has resulted in "unwanted outcomes." Fun fact: The CEO of IOS, Idris Shonuga, is also the President of PEDPAN. Although a report from ICIR shows Shonuga was removed as president in 2022, he was recognised as the president of PEDPAN and CEO of IOS in a CNBC Africa interview in July 2023. LagosRide is not privy to arrangements between partners and drivers, but Adeyemi said the platform is "now working behind the scenes to ensure that we review our entire product system." This review will lead to what he calls LagosRide version 2 — a way to ensure that "stakeholders get fair representation and fair compensation." Why drivers are angry with LagosRide While LagosRide drivers believe they should be protected by LagosRide from unfair partnerships, some also believe LagosRide is making it easy for partners like IOS to exploit their desperation. "Corruption has taken over the place," one driver said. Most of the drivers that spoke to Techpoint Africa, said that getting a vehicle directly from LagosRide is difficult even when you have your ₦700,000 down payment. They believe the partners have a better chance of getting a vehicle because they pay up to ₦1 million ($1,333); an extra ₦300,000 some drivers would describe as a bribe. "I went to LagosRide with my ₦700,000, they told me there was no car, but a partner I know personally got a car from LagosRide with ₦1.2 million ($1,624)." We reached out to the partner in question but he denied the driver's claims, insisting he did not pay more than the ₦700,000 down payment. So why aren't drivers getting vehicles? "It is not completely true that the scheme is skewed in favour of the partners. There's a context with which things have happened," Adeyemi explained. Post-launch, it approached PEDPAN in a bid to onboard its members as drivers. However, many complained that they could not afford the down payment. Before the partnership scheme, LagosRide partnered with Polaris Bank to provide financing for the down payment which was initially ₦1.5 million. All the drivers needed to do was pay a 20% — ₦300,000 ($406) — deposit on the down payment. "They were supposed to be direct beneficiaries, they had walked away or they didn't have money. The people that now had money had come into play." The play was for 1,000 cars which he didn't say had all been paid for. He, however, said it was unlikely that there were any more cars available. But many drivers believe the cars are still available. One of them showed a video of several LagosRide vehicles parked in one of the company's garages in Lagos. Responding, Adeyemi said those were most likely repossessed cars. But concerning partners paying a little extra to increase their chances of getting a vehicle, Adeyemi reiterated that he is primarily responsible for LagosRide's technology; Ibile Holdings — the investment company of the Lagos State Government — is concerned with LagosRide's operations and allotting vehicles. Pricing falls within his purview and that is a subject that compounds the already difficult arrangements drivers have with riders. Like Bolt and Uber drivers, LagosRide drivers want a significant increase in the price of rides. While LagosRide has already reviewed prices, many drivers remain unsatisfied. According to a message sent to LagosRide drivers, fare prices per kilometre (km) went from, ₦121.5 (0.16) to ₦137.41 ($0.19)/km, about ₦7 higher than Bolt's. Adeyemi said a ride-sharing feature will be coming to the app that will allow riders to carpool, reduce overhead costs, and increase the earnings of the drivers. But most drivers aren't just looking to earn more, they want to own the cars they've financed for four years. ** Dollar equivalent is from exchange rate as of September 11, 2023.
Backed by the Gates Foundation, i3 announces second cohort of healthcare supply chain startups Wella Health, Famasi, and Healthtracka are among 29 startups that will receive an equity-free grant of $50,000 from i3, a pan-African initiative focusing on the healthcare supply chain sector. Now in its second year, the program is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with support from Cencora (formerly AmerisourceBergen), Merck Sharpe & Dohme (MSD), Microsoft, and Chemonics. In addition to the grant, selected startups will receive investment readiness support from CcHUB, Villgro Africa, IMPACT Lab, and Startupbootcamp Afritech. They also represent 21 African countries, while 38% of the startups are led by women. "As countries and global health institutions work to expand access to priority products, we face an urgent need to leverage solutions across the public and private sectors to improve health outcomes and strengthen local health systems. Programs like i3 help us understand, support, and engage with technology-driven solutions emerging across Africa, hand-in-hand with our partners," Kieran Daly, Director, Global Health Agencies and Funds at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said in a statement to Techpoint Africa. New startups in Africa's healthcare supply chain sector declined by 81% between 2021 and 2022 – Report For the first cohort, the 31 startups received support to reach 24,000 healthcare facilities across 26 African countries. Through investor matching sessions, nearly 40% raised follow-on funding amounting to $5.4 million. There's a heavy emphasis on supply chain startups by i3, and Muyi Aina, Principal, Solina Health, confirms that it's intentional. "It's easier to measure with supply chain companies what you're able to achieve. Based on the lessons we learn, we will then expand outside of [the] supply chain." While still in its second year, Aina explained that the first cohort reinforced i3's hypothesis that there was a significant funding gap for the healthcare sector. "One surprise to me is that there's a very robust system [and] a very robust number of innovators in this space at different stages. So it's not for want of people who are trying to do things; it's other things that keep them from reaching the scale that they should reach," he said. But while there's significant activity going on in the sector, Aina says the first cohort showed a dearth of management capabilities in the founders. Furthermore, many startups that applied were not ready for external investment. While the focus has been on supply chain startups, he stresses that i3 would like to see more diversity in the business models of startups that apply. i3 is not the only Gates Foundation-backed initiative targeting the healthcare sector in Africa. In August, 29 African researchers were selected to build artificial intelligence applications for healthcare solutions on the continent. Such initiatives have ignited conversations about the involvement of the Gates Foundation in Africa, but Aina is more concerned with the solutions this support births. "I can't help what cynicism or skepticism individuals or groups have. I think i3 is a good program, and for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to invest in it is a positive thing. For many other activities of the foundation that I'm familiar with, they're very altruistic and filling gaps that we are not filling ourselves. "If others will step up and fund it, why not? So I don't think it's a requirement that one funder, whoever it is, must be the one to do something, but let others step up and do it. You cannot be doing something, somebody steps up to do it and you criticize without base."
Cloudfare partners CloudHop to improve cybersecurity in Africa Last Saturday, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) launched a self-service option for Nigerians to apply for their National Identification Numbers (NINs) using their smartphones. Why? Abisoye Coker-Odusote, the Acting Director General/CEO of NIMC, said, “We are striving to expedite the registration process. Many ordinary Nigerians have expressed frustration with the current registration procedures, citing extended wait times and delayed feedback after completing the registration.” In 2022, the NIMC issued National Identity Numbers to 22,492,748 Nigerians, a 16.85% decrease from the 27,052,148 issued in 2021. Here's what I've got for you today: Cloudfare partners CloudHop to improve cybersecurity in Africa Services on the eCitizen's platform exceed the 5K target Cloudfare partners CloudHop to improve cybersecurity in Africa Cloudflare, an American IT service management company, has partnered with CloudHop, a Kenyan company, to distribute its technology solutions. It plans to improve cybersecurity using cutting-edge techniques to protect digital assets and user data throughout Africa. While Cloudflare provides web performance and security solutions to millions of websites worldwide, CloudHop offers cloud computing and data management solutions in Africa. The collaboration will enable CloudHop to provide Cloudflare's services to its clients. One of these services is Cloudflare CDN, a content delivery network that shortens the time it takes for websites to load by caching content closer to users at the Internet's edge. Additionally, it will provide Cloudflare SSL, a secure sockets layer that encrypts user and website data to ensure privacy and security, and Cloudflare Firewall, a web application firewall that prevents malicious requests and attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and DDoS. Why does it matter? Given the continent's rapid digitisation of businesses and services, there has never been a more pressing need for effective cybersecurity measures. Cyberattacks affect a company's performance and reputation by impacting digital assets and user data. Thus, having trustworthy and efficient solutions in place to safeguard websites from hackers, malware, and other threats is crucial. Services on the eCitizen's platform exceed the 5K target The number of services on Kenya's eCitizen platform has surpassed 7,453, exceeding the initial 5,000 target. This news comes a few weeks after a Sudanese hacker group — Anonymous Sudan — hacked the eCitizen platform, disrupting its operations. Launched in 2014, eCitizen is a self-service portal that gives Kenyan citizens online access to several government services, including passport applications, licence renewals, business registrations, and land searches. The platform aims to make it easier for citizens to interact with the government by providing a single point of contact. Users must first create an account using their email address or ID number to use the platform. After that, users can log in to access the services they need. Eliud Owalo, the ICT Cabinet Secretary, reported that an additional 6,817 services had undergone partial digitisation. The Competition Authority of Kenya and the Kenya Ports Authority, which transitioned in February and March 2023, respectively, are among the latest organisations to onboard services onto the platform. Expectedly, other organisations, including the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Kenya National Library Services (KNLS), Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), Communication Authority of Kenya (CA), the judiciary, and Teachers Service Commission (TSC) will automate their services.

Pick n Pay launches PayJustNow During my illness, I realised how important it is to watch what I consume. My body rejects some foods, which is surprising for someone with little to no cooking skills but a strong desire to learn. (Nah, don’t give me that look. I’m not that bad; I can try.) Previously, a doctor gave me a list of foods to avoid, which made me wonder what else I would eat. Anyway, I have come to terms with the fact that I need to be more deliberate about what I feed my body and mind. You should, too. By the way, I’m sure you enjoyed the newsletters from Bolu and Ogheneruemu. Send a shout-out to them because they are the best. Okay, send one to Chimgozirim, too. He worked behind the scenes. If you don’t have plans for the weekend, maybe you can rest and join Nifemi and Bolaji Shote, Senior Human Resources Consultant, tomorrow, Saturday, September 16, 2023, by 5 p.m. WAT on Zoom. They'll be diving deep into actionable strategies on maintaining a healthy workplace tailored for the African context. To attend, register here. Here's what I've got for you today: Flutterwave plans to invest $50m in Kenya Pick n Pay launches PayJustNow Liquid launches two terrestrial routes Flutterwave plans to invest $50m in Kenya Two days ago, in a media interview in Nairobi, Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-founder, disclosed the company's plan to invest $50 million in Kenya. Remember, in April 2023, Flutterwave announced plans to set up an East African office in Kenya. As Agboola reiterated the company's intention to open a new office in Kenya, he also said Flutterwave would expand its infrastructure and hire staff there. Interestingly, the fintech currently has 27 employees in Kenya. The fintech startup has applied for a payments service provider licence and a remittances licence to allow electronic funds transfers, money deposits, and withdrawals. Consequently, Flutterwave will invest in the country once it gets its licence. This news comes after the company’s first-name approval from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). Sidebar: On September 4, 2023, Flutterwave launched Swap, backed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as a digital platform for Nigerians to gain immediate access to foreign currency at competitive exchange rates. Pick n Pay launches PayJustNow Pick n Pay, a South African retailer, has introduced PayJustNow, a buy now, pay later service, at its hypermarket locations. With PayJustNow, customers can purchase electronics, mobile devices, home appliances, clothing, and other high-ticket non-food items on credit with an option to split payments into three convenient instalments. Customers will pay 34% of the total payment upfront, and the other two, each for 33%, will be due on the same dates as their upcoming paychecks. Pick n Pay said the service is free and interest-free While the service is available online, PayJustNow will be accessible in-store for products with the company's logo on them. Customers will scan the QR code on these products via the PayJustNow app. The application process takes less than 10 minutes to complete, and eligible customers will receive a special WiCode generated by the PayJustNow app that will allow them to purchase at the Pick n Pay checkout within 15 minutes. What’s more, the company claims it will extend the service to its clothing division. Liquid launches two terrestrial routes Liquid Intelligent Technologies (Liquid) has launched two terrestrial routes linking Kenya to Ethiopia and Zambia to Malawi. The first route is a 1,000-kilometer fibre connection between Ethiopia and Kenya, and the second is a 711km fibre network that supports the fibre route between Zambia and Malawi. Expectedly, the fibre connection between Kenya and Ethiopia will promote greater business cooperation between the two nations. Besides, Ethiopian businesses now have access to Nairobi's data centres and cloud. Liquid, Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (KETRACO), and Ethiopia Electric Power (EEP) partnered to complete the fibre-optic link from Kenya to Ethiopia. The new link, which has a four-terabyte-per-second capacity, completes the existing terrestrial routes, increasing data traffic along the route. The Zambia-Malawi fibre route connects the two countries to South African content caches and data centres.

For $120 annually, Fleri offers African immigrants a substitute for sending money home to cover medical costs It is safe to assume that many business ideas come from the experiences of the entrepreneurs or people they know. For instance, the demise of a loved one inspired the concept for Healthtracka, a Nigerian healthtech startup. The co-founder and CEO of Chekker, another Nigerian healthtech startup, also got the idea for the business after his mother's long wait for a laboratory test. To further illustrate my point, Sam Baddoo, CEO of healthtech startup, Fleri, says that in business, the problem to solve chooses the entrepreneur or the entrepreneur selects the issue to solve. His claim stems from the understanding that unless a person has first-hand experience or is very close to a situation, they can’t fully understand its implications. As an immigrant, Baddoo is aware of some of the dangers and challenges that immigrants face in the US and countries in North Africa. He was born and raised in Ghana and, after secondary school, moved to Morocco on a United Nation's scholarship where he spent the next five years studying French and Arabic. Baddoo first became aware of immigration as a significant global issue during his time in Morocco while volunteering for Comité d'Entraide Internationale, a non-profit that assists stranded immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. There, he met people who had emigrated for several reasons, including seeking a better life. Some risked their lives crossing the desert on foot, others travelled in boats that capsized. Globally, many immigrants sell their properties in their home countries in search of a better life. He returned to Ghana five years later, where he spent the next four years building two businesses with some friends. He eventually left the businesses and moved to the US, where he worked multiple jobs and sent money home to meet many needs, including his family's medical care. Sadly, his country's broken healthcare system contributed to the deaths of his uncle in 2018, grandfather in 2020, and grandmother in 2021. How Fleri chose Sam Baddoo Fleri is the Haitian Creole word for "flourish". Baddoo says he chose that because the country’s economy relies on remittances. In the past decade, Haiti has become one of the world's most reliant countries on remittances. Immigrant transfers increased from 12% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012 to more than 25% in 2022, or approximately $3.5 billion. Fleri's goal is for immigrants in the diaspora to flourish, moving them from just surviving to thriving in their chosen paths, starting with healthcare. Having lost family members, Baddoo was inspired to start Fleri in 2020. In Baddoo's grandmother's case, the problem was not an unavailability of funds but a lack of trust in the healthcare system. He thinks she would have gotten better care if she had gone to the hospital as advised instead of using the money he sent home to visit a traditional healer.This loss, he says, will always hurt him the most. "Immigrants go through so much to get to where they are, and what we hope to do on our end is empower them to make the most of the opportunity and reap the benefits of the difficult circumstances they endured to get where they are. “Having lived here [the US] and been primarily responsible for my family in Ghana, those challenges are not unique to me. I understand them very well. And so, when you keep experiencing something repeatedly, you have two options: continue to go through it or decide to do something about it." Consequently, he decided to assist other immigrants to provide better care for their loved ones without jeopardising their financial future. In 2021, he launched Fleri. Fleri wants immigrants' loved ones back home to flourish Providing an alternative to sending cash home for medical expenses, Fleri is a migrant family care platform that helps people who have moved abroad find and manage healthcare access for their loved ones back home. Immigrants in North America, including the US and Canada, and the UK, can buy health insurance plans for their loved ones for as little as $120 a year. Once they sign up as members, they can add as many loved ones as they are accountable for as beneficiaries in their home countries: Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mali, Senegal, Algeria, Nigeria, and Ghana. Consider it a form of health insurance where you add your spouse and children to a health insurance plan, but the primary distinction with Fleri is that the person who registers their loved ones are in diaspora. Obtaining health insurance is mandatory in Nigeria; here is how to get it "What you get is a family care manager who will look after your loved ones and check in with them every two weeks. We give each beneficiary an assigned primary carer with whom they can ask questions and schedule medical appointments." Given that the member might have multiple family members spread out across different locations, the family care manager calls and checks in with their loved ones via WhatsApp instead of paying them a visit every fortnight. Carers provide guidance and establish preventative care routines. The business offers care coordination services, including consultations and specialist meetings. Also, Baddoo maintains that Fleri takes all the necessary steps to ensure the members’ loved ones receive the care they require. Fleri sends monthly beneficiary wellness reports to every beneficiary a member adds. It has a health emergency fund that enables the company to pay for an emergency in advance. The immigrant has roughly 14 days to repay at zero interest. Baddoo says this is available to members because they are paying-subscribers. Not every beneficiary has the same medical issues or life circumstances, so some might require more than preventative care. Consequently, members can use its health marketplace to find a suitable care plan for their loved ones, including Mental Health, Chronic Care, Elderly, At-Home, and Emergency Responses. Fleri collaborates with several health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and healthtech companies in these African nations, including Tangerine Africa, Reliance Health, AXA Mansard, MyCover.ai, and WellaHealth. It also works with financial partners to manage escrow and payments to healthcare providers. This service is accessible online and has a help desk potential customers can call to have an employee walk them through the process. Scaling in a competitive market DiaspoCare, a Minnesota-based healthtech company, is one of Fleri's many international competitors; it is also up against local competition. The platform facilitates seamless care between Africans who have moved abroad and their families and carers back home. Immigrants purchase vouchers for their relatives in Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana. Nigerian healthtech startup, WellaHealth, introduced HealthSend in June 2023 as a subsidiary, allowing Nigerians living abroad to send money home. They can use the service to top up a website wallet system and pay for many healthcare services the company offers for their family members back home. Clafiya, a Nigerian healthtech startup, offers a similar product. Clafiya offers in-patient visits and virtual consultations, changing how Nigerians access healthcare Like other similar businesses, Fleri knows that customers send money for many reasons, including healthcare. So, it eliminates the need for family members to receive care primarily through financial transfers by developing products and crucial partnerships that directly enable the required care. However, Baddoo maintains that Fleri stands out because it focuses on immigrants rather than just healthcare, emphasising that it understands their challenges and develops novel solutions. He says the startup has a unique strategy, stating that its non-transactional approach to customer engagement entails enrolling these immigrants as members. It then leverages their relationship to provide the care they need rather than forcing them to accept a specific type of care. Fleri believes that its customers, not the company, determine their needs. It, therefore, collaborates with them to help them access their families’ needs, ensuring customer satisfaction. “If it is a surgery, Fleri can assist you in covering it. We can also help you cover it if you need to travel to another country for medical treatment or if it’s a referral to another provider or medication.” The company has received funding from several investors, including Village Capital, ODBA, Launch Africa, Techstars, and Founders Factory Africa. Expanding in the face of challenges Remittances are typically transfers between individuals. They generally refer to money immigrants send home to support their families, which helps to alleviate poverty and improve well-being. While Baddoo points out that immigrants are used to sending money home to pay for healthcare, it can be challenging to build the trust and credibility necessary to convince people to change their habits and do something new, like adding their loved ones as beneficiaries. Although this is the company's greatest challenge, it plans to improve over time as it increases marketing and educates more people to raise awareness. Meanwhile, over 4,000 members use the platform, and it plans to more than double the number, approaching 10,000 members, by the end of 2023. With its team spread across several countries, including Ghana, Nigeria, the UK, the US, and Barbados, the company plans to expand from 18 to over 20 employees before the end of the year. The startup intends to launch Fleri for Businesses and Communities before 2023 ends. These offerings will enable it to collaborate with immigrant community organisations like businesses, churches, and other associations, which will lower the cost of the annual membership for their members. This move will help Fleri reach as many people as possible, relieving them of the stress and responsibility of caring for their loved ones. It also plans to expand into more African countries before the end of the year.

After receiving first-name approval from the Central Bank of Kenya, Flutterwave plans to invest $50m in Kenya Flutterwave, a Nigerian fintech company, plans to invest $50 million in Kenya. Olugbenga Agboola, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-Founder, revealed this in a media interview in Nairobi. He added the company has received first-name approval from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and it’s prepared for phased investments once it gets a licence. In April 2023, Flutterwave announced it would establish its primary operations station in Nairobi for the East African market. Agboola reiterated the company's intention to open a new office there, and also stated that it would expand its infrastructure and hire staff in the country. Flutterwave currently has 27 employees in Kenya. It has submitted applications for a payments service provider licence and a remittances licence to allow electronic funds transfers, money deposits, and withdrawals. “There is a lot to do in Kenya. We are happy we are going through the process of approval. We didn’t chicken out. We stayed the course even when everything stopped. The current administration is very supportive,” the CEO said. Flutterwave launched Swap, backed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on September 4, 2023, as a digital platform for Nigerians to gain immediate access to foreign currency at competitive exchange rates. Last week, it partnered with an Indian bank, IndusInd, to launch its remittance service, Send App, in the Asian country. The collaboration allows anyone using Flutterwave to transfer funds from India to the 30 African nations where the fintech company operates.
Mecho Autotech raises $2.4m pre-Series A to expand into wholesale spare parts distribution The news: Mecho Autotech, a Nigerian startup that offers vehicle repairs and maintenance has raised $2.4 million pre-Series A to expand into wholesale spare parts distribution. The funding round had the participation of Global Brain Corporation, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund. Mecho will use the funding to build a marketplace for spare parts and offer financing to workshop owners and spare parts dealers. Nigeria spends $10 billion annually on the importation of vehicle spare parts. Mecho Autotech wants to capture that market with its $2.4 million pre-Series A. The investment had the participation of Global Brain Corporation, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund. Launched with the mission to provide vehicle maintenance and repair, the startup soon realised that spare parts were scarce in the country. According to the CEO and Co-founder, Olusegun Owoade, "Spare parts vendors face frequent stockouts and struggle to access inventory financing. "In our marketplace, vendors can source inventory from leading aftermarket spare parts manufacturers and access credit. By solving for spare parts stockouts, we can help solve one of the biggest problems in our industry.” The funding will help Mecho launch a B2B distribution platform for aftermarket spare parts. Using its network of manufacturers in Asia, the startup will provide parts like batteries, tyres and suspension, to wholesalers in Nigeria. Mecho plans to launch three platforms that will enable accurate data collection about the demand for spare parts in Nigeria. One of the apps will help corporate fleet owners get access to standard workshops in the country, provide maintenance data, and maintenance financing. Another platform will be built for workshops to get access to to vetted spare parts dealers while also providing them with finance of up to ₦10 million in partnership with banks. While Mecho says spare parts distribution is an expansion of its offerings, its viability could mean a complete pivot from vehicle repairs and maintenance.
Ugandan agritech startup, Emata, plans to expand its agri-loan offerings with a $2.4 million seed Ugandan agritech startup, Emata, has received $2.4 million in seed funding, comprising $800,000 in equity and $1.6 million in on-lending capital, to expand its agri-loan offerings across East Africa. The expansion will include Uganda and an impending international venture, with Tanzania being the most likely destination. African Renaissance Partners led the round with participation from several investors, including Norrsken Accelerator, Zephyr Acorn, Marcus Boström, and Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation. Founded in 2020, Emata collaborates with farming cooperatives to give farmers easy access to digital financing. It uses alternative credit scores based on data points like a farmer's delivery history instead of conventional collateral requirements. Emata helps farmers increase productivity by addressing farmers' access to funding as a company that partners with cooperatives and farmer-based organisations to fully digitise the lending process and incorporate it into the agricultural value chain. Its partners deduct loan payments on its behalf, so these partnerships guarantee access to a direct source of repayment. Emata reached over 40,000 individual farmers in 2022 after growing seven times year over year and forging alliances with 50 agricultural stakeholders. It has disbursed $1 million in loans. The startup will prioritise growing its core markets, particularly those in the dairy and coffee industries. This business, however, has its sights set on oilseeds, maize, and the opportunity to diversify into potatoes.

Olumide "D.O' Olusanya shares his perspective on KloudCommerce's demise, as he looks to pursue legal action Olumide "D.O" Olusanya, founder of now defunct Nigeria-based SaaS startup, KloudCommerce, is breaking his silence after over a year of financial controversy. KloudCommerce had lofty ambitions to reshape African retail, much like Nigeria's NIBBS changed digital payments and India's ONDC is altering digital commerce, by digitalising retailers and also enabling them to seamlessly sell their offline inventory online. However, internal conflicts and investor disagreements led to its shutdown in September 2022. Following this, WeeTracker published a report in which it alleged that a group of investors accused D.O of misusing company funds for personal gains, including lavish trips across the world. "These allegations are wild and misleading," says D.O, "Every decision made was in the best interest of the company." In this exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa, D.O, supported by testimonies from two other sources familiar with the situation, delves into his journey, the challenges faced by his venture, and confronts the allegations head-on. Central to his defense is investor Adedayo Amzat, whom D.O believes masterminded a thwarted aggressive takeover. This, he explains, involved swaying some co-investors, unsupportive co-founders, and led to such distress that his wife felt compelled to put him on "suicide watch". D.O first shared his perspective through a detailed Twitter thread on September 1st, 2023. The series of over 100 tweets, unfolding over a week, is laden with twists and intricate boardroom lingo that can be challenging for newcomers to understand. In retrospect, this may very well have been best thing that’s happened to my faith in God in a long while, for which I give glory to God🙌I am thrilled🤩 about the state of my present relationship with and trust in Him. He’s the ONLY one with the true ability to justify a man.— D.O (@davidicdoc) September 9, 2023 To make sense of D.O's defense, it's essential to first delve into the beginnings of KloudCommerce. A brief history of the origins of KloudCommerce: In the beginning, there was Gloo.ng KloudCommerce's roots lie in Gloopro, a still active eProcurement firm that emerged from the now-defunct online grocery store, Gloo.ng. D.O, a majority shareholder of Gloopro, often compares Gloo.ng to eCommerce titans Jumia and Konga, noting that they all debuted in 2012 within a month of one another. However, while Jumia and Konga had significant financial backing, Gloo.ng started as a self-funded side venture. Riding the eCommerce surge initiated by Konga and Jumia, Gloo.ng secured notable interviews with CNN and with Techpoint Africa in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Yet, the recession that hit Nigeria in 2016/2017 posed severe challenges, particularly impacting the eCommerce sector. Gloo.ng was not ompervious to the macroeconomic constraints. "Despite breaking even with our fulfillment centre, we were losing money to marketing and other overhead costs, " D.O recalls, "It was clear sustaining the entire business until it became profitable would be tough." A significant break came in 2018 when Unilever's head office, a major delivery cluster for Gloo.ng because of the many employees ordering from it, expressed interest in an eProcurement solution. Noticing the regular deliveries by staff in Gloo.ng attire, Unilever's leadership pondered why they hadn't adopted this widely-used service. "We said yes because the request came from the head office. We integrated with their SAP system and I dubbed it 'Enterprise Consumables Management System' (ECMS)." Within 3 months, they had signed another big client in Coca Cola to the ECMS. These moves marked Gloo.ng's break-even point, sparking an epiphany for D.O. He rallied his team, emphasising the urgent need to pivot and in 2019, with the blessing of investors and shareholders, they transitioned from B2C (Gloo.ng) to a B2B eProcurement platform (Gloopro) for corporates. Fellows, listen up! We’ve BIG news coming out of @Gloo_ng next month! We’ll be shutting down our ecommerce business & will be launching a new business we’ve built past 18months in stealth!💪🙌🏻 Ahead of that time, we’ll be selling off our inventory @ 50% discount! Stay tuned! "Today, we have on board pretty much most of the name brand customers; Unilever, Coca Cola, British American Tobacco, Seplat, and more." Within months of announcing Gloopro, D.O got another epiphany, to replicate the enterprise solution for other sectors. He kickstarted some internal research and they settled on the retail sector — an easy decision given that there was demand from an anchor customer. With a recent $1 million seed funding in hand, he aggressively recruited engineering talent. D.O says he christened this new solution 'Gloopro Septa' but that two years into building it, he realised something crucial. "Because both products (ECMS and Gloopro Septa) operated on entirely different code bases targeting distinct markets, it became clear that combining such diverse entities posed risks. Cultural clashes could arise, leading to disputes over compensation and roles." He also realised that retaining the engineers he recruited for Gloopro Septa would soon pose a financial challenge for Gloopro. "So I convened an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to discuss these constraints," D.O recalls, "stressing that Gloopro couldn't sustain funding the project. We had to branch out and seek external investors to support the product's development." With the permission of the Gloopro board, D.O took with him David Umoh, Gloopro CTO at the time, and all but one of the engineers who had worked on Gloopro Septa, and registered PayPecker UK Limited on the 2nd of December, 2020. PayPecker would eventually be renamed KloudCommerce. Clarifying KloudCommerce's share structure According to D.O, the Gloopro board agreed to move the Gloopro Septa IP to the new company in exchange for a 20% stake, based on an estimate of having expended $750,000 up to that moment to build the product. This effectively set KloudCommerce's initial valuation at $3.75 million. Along with David Umoh whom he took from Gloopro, D.O recruited a Chief Product Officer by name of Frank Atashili. They were granted co-founder status and allotted shares of 15% and 10% respectively, while D.O was allotted 55%. But certain Gloopro investors had voiced concerns over a potential conflict of interest, given D.O's dual roles as a founder and primary shareholder in Gloopro while also being a founder of the new entity. "To address these concerns, I offered that all three co-founders, including myself would be getting stock options, rather than equity, that would have to vest over a four year-period." This meant that at the outset, neither D.O nor his co-founders could access their shares. In contrast, Gloopro's 20% was fully vested, granting it complete ownership from the start. "This ensured Gloopro's protection as the product's originator, " D.O explains, "For balance however, all co-founders were granted one share (0.000001%) each and voting rights, to the degree of the options alloted to them" He acknowledges that the setup allowed him, as the founder and primary shareholder, to nominate three board members, while Gloopro had one slot. Following the board's unanimous decision, D.O began developing KloudCommerce. Between May and July of 2021, he closed $500,000 in pre-seed funding from a number of investors, through SAFE notes. He underscores that every investor was aware of the shareholders' agreement and content with his four-year vesting schedule. New investors had the potential to dilute existing shareholders' stakes. However, because funding was secured through SAFE notes, investors couldn't assert equity or board positions until a future seed round, which is the typical protocol for SAFE investments. The lead SAFE investor expressed concerns about D.O's founder privileges. "To protect their (SAFE investors) interests, we existing shareholders agreed to revise the shareholder agreement to ensure no founder could receive a new set of options in the future," D.O explains. Meanwhile, he retained his right to nominate three people, including a SAFE investor, to the board, but as his top choices were unavailable, he chose to prioritise business growth over constituting the board for the time being. Addressing the allegations D.O swiftly refutes claims that he spent recklessly and prioritised the business over the product. He stresses that with over twenty years of domain expertise, he stands by decisions made in the company's best interest. Contrary to the portrayal in the WeeTracker report, it would appear that he didn't make many of these decisions brashly or unilaterally. About trip to Ghana D.O explains that in addition to the CTO and CPO, he brought on board a seasoned operations specialist as the COO. Since he joined later in the process, he wasn't granted stock options. However, he did invest in a follow-on pre-seed round through SAFE notes. "He (the COO) immediately got to work on our go to market strategy," D.O recalls, "We realised that the retail industry that we're targeting is the most conferenced and most exhibited industry in the world, including in Africa. In our search, we found over 200 exhibitions across the contient." Previously, during the Gloopro Septa phase, D.O recognised that selling to retailers required a markedly different approach than marketing other tech products. "Retailers are just too busy during the day for formal sales pitches in boardrooms. However, when they attend exhibitions, they're more open to sales pitches because they go with the mindset of learning what's new." D.O coined this approach the "Events-based Distro Strategy". It involved showcasing at exhibition events across Africa, starting with the Food & Beverage West Africa and Beauty West Africa events in Lagos, Nigeria, and also being the primary sponsor for Accra Fashion Week in Ghana. "Our model, from day one was Africa first. I had already built companies in Nigeria for 20 years, I wasn't interested in doing that anymore." The COO personally secured our headline sponsorship for the Accra Fashion Week and even managed to negotiate a significant discount on the price," D.O clarifies, addressing WeeTracker's claims of excessive expenditure for the event. The Accra Fashion Week was scheduled for December 2021. D.O dispatched the COO and a newly appointed Africa Expansion Manager to Accra in advance. Once there, they hired three local employees and established an office. "From that period leading up to the Accra event, we identified over 4,000 businesses, which we added to the top of our funnel, and signed up more than 300 of them," recalls the Africa Expansion Manager who spoke with Techpoint Africa on the condition of anonymity. His job desription entailed replicating the model in Nairobi and Johanesburg, and Cairo. He however didn't get the chance to witness the full success, as he resigned for personal reasons in January. "I went home in December to spend time with my family after being away for several months," he reminisces. "During my stay, an opportunity in Lagos arose, which would clash with my responsibilities in Ghana. Around the same time, the Ghanaian government mandated the COVID vaccine for re-entry. I hadn't taken the vaccine." This led to his resignation, a significant setback for D.O who was left with a singular option: to remain and fulfill his CEO duties remotely while also managing expansion in Accra. His public stance against the COVID vaccine meant he couldn't return to Nigeria. Doing so would prevent his re-entry to Ghana, leaving the local team leaderless. The COO had returned to Nigeria following the close of the Accra Fashion Week. I questioned D.O about the allegations of excessive spending in Ghana, to which he replied, "Would I stay in a hotel for over two months on my own dime? In fact, it was COO himself who found a more cost-effective hotel and secured a bulk discount when it became evident I'd be in Accra for an extended period." On questionable product decisions Despite the promising business metrics, KloudCommerce's products faced challenges, including missed targets and flawed demos. D.O, countering the WeeTracker report, stresses that he never misled investors. "Our initial business model, outlined in our pre-seed pitch deck, was revenue generation based on inventory location," he clarifies. "Here, 'inventory location' doesn't refer to the number of stores but rather denotes any spot within a client's store or chain where they wish to digitally manage and transfer inventory." D.O elaborates that in January 2022, as they contemplated a seed round, feedback from potential investors indicated a need to shift their KPIs. Instead of focusing on the number of inventory locations they were acquiring, they were required to emphasise the volume processed through these locations. The leading potential seed investor also wanted to observe progress over three months with the new KPI. D.O maintains that he regularly shared his investor updates with his co-founders, to review, before sending them. "Yet, from June to December 2021, during the crucial six months of product development and market introduction, the product wasn't ready for the three pivotal events meant for market capture and customer acquisition. We had already made payments for these events. So, I concentrated on acquiring customers with the unfinished product, ensuring that once it was finalised, on-boarding them would simply be a matter of flipping a switch." The Africa Expansion Manager affirms D.O's account. "I was directed to forward every business we on-boarded to the Lagos team. They would handle the KYC processes towards transitioning these businesses into paying customers." I point out that the WeeTracker report cites key executives who allege that he often shifted the product's direction too suddenly. "How could I have such an influence when I wasn't directly in charge of product development? If a product is deployed at a client's location and doesn't function as expected, am I the one who coded it? Did I supervise the coders? That's the duty of the product co-founder." In D.O's opinion, this what led to disagreements and the resistance he began to face from his co-founders. "I foresaw that these issues could lead to the company's downfall. I was the one actively seeking investments, not them. I pitched to investors based on their assurances regarding product readiness. Their failure to deliver was a direct blow and embarrassment to me," he expresses. Nevertheless, by March 2022, after D.O returned to Nigeria, he supported the Sales Lead in signing a major anchor customer that had exclusive rights to distributing global lifestyle and beauty brands across West Africa. But a scheduled product demo and go-live sequence at the anchor customer's premises failed. "That was the last straw for me. They had three extra months, and yet there were still complaints and excuses. I wasn't accepting any more of it." By this time, KloudCommerce was already running out of funds. So he went to some of the investors to show them the full picture of things. One of them was Adedayo Amzat of Zedcrest Capital, whom he says was the SAFE investor with the most skin in the game. The immediate priority was to establish a board, aiming to introduce governance in the product's management. Boardroom drama It's essential to recall that, based on the shareholder's agreement, only D.O and Gloopro had the privilege to occupy or nominate someone for a board seat, as a seed round hadn't been initiated yet. "To adequately represent all stakeholders — the founders, SAFE investors, and Gloopro — I utilised my rights and nominated myself, Adedayo Amazat, and a representative from Gloopro to the board," D.O explains. The first board meeting, held on the 1st of April, 2022, went well by all indications. Also in attendance were co-founders Umoh and Atashili. "The board acknowledged the disagreements among us co-founders. They instructed us to convene a co-founder meeting to address our issues, as they appeared to be related to product direction rather than personal conflicts," D.O recalls. D.O highlights that because they were running low on cash, he had stopped collecting salaries, equivalent to the end of January, while his co-founders had started accepting half payments. "I and the co-founders met the next day, he recalls, "During this meeting, when questioned about their commitment to continue on half salaries, the co-founders expressed that they might be compelled to depart in 3 months if the situation persisted. I was taken aback. These were individuals to whom I had granted 10% and 15% stakes in a company now valued at $5.1 million, especially after securing an additional pre-seed funding of around $150,000 from existing investors." At that first board meeting, Amzat inquired about directly communicating with the co-founders, to which D.O did not object. "However, to my surprise, Amzat and the co-founders began having conversations behind the scenes that portrayed me unfavourably," he recalls. Adedayo had proudly shared with me a screencap of his WhatsApp interaction with one of my cofounders that I had previously indicated was the most committed and most loyal—to spite me I guess. I showed same to the COO and the said cofounder must have gotten to know about same.— D.O (@davidicdoc) September 1, 2023 "That's when it became clear to me that something fishy was happening." At this point, I reference the WeeTracker report, which claims that he drew a salary for several months while withholding pay from some team members and also misappropriated investments meant for the company. "That's completely untrue," D.O asserts. I never prioritised my salary over my employees'. In fact, it was only until March 2022 that we faced challenges in disbursing staff salaries due to a shortage of funds and a delay in anticipated investments. By this time, I personally had stopped drawing salaries since January. I even secured a personal loan on the company's behalf to pay staff salaries for April." I stood in the gap for Apr’22 staff salaries totaling N15M (excluding mine): I’d gone to secure as loan to the company from empathic friends in the ecosystem, I gave personal guarantees of payback. The need to pay this back was discountenanced, soon after offering to recuse…— D.O (@davidicdoc) September 1, 2023 As for the supposed misdirection of funds to Paymente Limited (Gloopro), he says, "it's essential to note that during KloudCommerce's early operational months, prior to obtaining our pre-seed funding, Gloopro shouldered various expenses, including rent, printing, internet, laptops, salaries and more. The mentioned funds were related party transactions, merely a partial repayment for the debts KloudCommerce, now operating independently, had with Gloopro. Repayments were executed upon the Gloopro board's request." According to D.O, rather than giving him an opportunity to address or clarify these perceived discrepancies, Amzat formed a WhatsApp group with a segment of SAFE investors and disseminated misleading information about him. He is convinced that Amzat's motive was to initiate a hostile takeover, rather than genuinely assisting the company in realigning with the product roadmap. "If he truly believed there was financial misconduct, he should have utilised the governance structure in place," D.O emphasises, "There's a protocol for such concerns. It should be reported to the board. Following that, the board would convene a panel, which would then commission an external auditor to conduct a thorough review. Only after this audit would the external auditor make a declaration regarding any potential financial impropriety." The accusations circulating in the WhatsApp group prompted the block of SAFE investors to request a comprehensive stakeholders' meeting. This meeting would involve all investors, D.O, and his executive team. They prepared a list of topics and concerns to be addressed during this meeting, which was set for Saturday, 27th May 2022. The meeting took an unexpected turn when Amazat and D.O engaged in a heated verbal exchange. The intensity of their disagreement led the SAFE investor who was chairing the session to prematurely end the meeting. After that intense confrontation, D.O felt it was best to resign from his role as CEO. "Given the atmosphere and the sense that trust in my leadership might have eroded, especially with Amzat's evident disdain for me, I felt it was the right decision." He took the initiative to communicate his decision to the investor who had overseen the meeting. He also approached Amzat with his decision to resign, and Amzat agreed to invest more funds into KloudCommerce on the condition of D.O's departure. "I was fine with that," D.O reflects, "I didn't start KloudCommerce with the intention of being its CEO for more than 4 years. My primary concern was the product, and we had spent too much time on board room drama. Even though only about 21% of my stock options had vested over my 18-month tenure, I was more interested in the company regaining its focus on the product." Amzat extended an invitation to D.O to meet at Zedvance HQ in Lagos to discuss the terms of a subsequent investment and D.O's departure. He proposed an additional investment of $200,000 into KloudCommerce and also expressed his intention to encourage other SAFE investors to increase their stakes. "In exchange, I was expected to relinquish 10% of my unvested share options and stay on as a consultant for a year before making my final exit," D.O recalls. "To my surprise, the term sheet he presented later was not what we had agreed upon in our meeting. Instead of the initial understanding, he proposed to slash my shareholding from 55% down to 29%, with 21% of that already vested. He also allocated an extra 15% to himself and dispersed the rest among certain investors and non-investors." Still desperate to save the company, D.O says he was willing to accept the terms, especially as it committed to paying the $200,000 within 24 hours. "On the very day I got that email, I convened a staff meeting to announce my resignation. I assured them that funds were on the way to cover salaries, which were only a month behind, and to manage operational costs. I informed them that the COO would be taking over my responsibilities," D.O recalls. However, in an unexpected turn of events, D.O says he received a revised term sheet from Amzat the next day. "He now proposed an investment of merely $50,000, with a commitment to help secure the remaining $150,000. Additionally, he intended to allocate the earlier mentioned 15% to his company, Zedcrest Capital, an entirely new entity on the cap table. And, to add insult to injury, he wanted me to waive six months of my unpaid salaries. There was no way I was accepting that." The situation became increasingly tense, stretching into June. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to D.O, staff began to whisper that his refusal to accept the investment terms was the reason for their two months of unpaid salaries. "They were unaware of the unfavourable conditions I was being presented with," D.O recalls. The pressure reached a boiling point, with even other SAFE investors attempting, unsuccessfully, to mediate. D.O says that the immense strain eventually led him to the emergency room due to stress-induced complications. Facing relentless pressure to tender his official resignation as CEO, D.O stood his ground, viewing Amzat's actions as an attempt at a hostile takeover without any legal foundation. He signed the term sheet but demanded a clear and binding share restructuring agreement that would clarify all ambiguous aspects of the term sheet. "I was well aware that such an agreement would necessitate the signatures of all existing shareholders," he explains. In the interim, Amzat had already fulfilled his promise of a $50,000 investment. Despite the ongoing disputes, D.O says he continued to uphold his end of the agreement, fulfilling his direct responsibilities outlined in the term sheet. "Even amidst the chaos," D.O recalls, "I managed to secure a partnership with a major international athletic brand that was in the process of launching its inaugural direct retail outlets in Nigeria." The negotiations dragged on, with various attempts at mediation. As rumuors about D.O's alleged misappropriation of funds persisted until August, the Gloopro board took notice and summoned D.O to face investigative inquiry of the board. "I was cleared of any wrongdoing," D.O explains. Another investor who had stakes in both Gloopro and KloudCommerce offered to setup a different meeting to mediate between D.O and Amzat. The conclusion of that meeting was that the old term sheet was a non-binding agreement, just as D.O had insisted. "After some discussions, which I wasn't a part of but involved some KloudCommerce executives, they returned with an absurd counteroffer," D.O recounts. As D.O shared on Twitter, this counteroffer aimed to drastically reduce Gloopro's stake in KloudCommerce from 20% to a mere 5%. Additionally, D.O's stake was also proposed to be slashed to 5%. The CTO, who had left by this time, was down to nothing. …for same—by the said 2 sponsoring execs and ZedCrest, whilst diluting the Gloopro interest to 5% from 20% and mine also to 5% from the starting 55% I had exactly a year before. (This equally diluted all other existing entities on the Kloud cap table.£ pic.twitter.com/w3GtF7HRVh— D.O (@davidicdoc) September 9, 2023 Unsurprisingly, the Gloopro board declined this term sheet. It's worth noting that the board had previously valued the resources and efforts they invested in developing the KloudCommerce IP at $750,000, which equated to a 20% fully paid share in the company. "Unbeknown to me, whilst concurrently involved in this new reconciliation and negotiation effort with me, Adedayo had also surreptitiously circulated a draft petition to be sent to EFCC on the back of his spurious allegations and wanted SAFE investors to execute quietly behind me, " D.O shares in a follow-on Tweet, "I got to know of this from one of KloudCommerce’s vendors." That attempt apparently failed. Especially because Tunde Ogunremi, a top three SAFE investor, was vocal about his refusal to sign the petition. "I knew for a fact that the allegations about money being spent on personal items and travelling across the world, were false, Ogunremi told Techpoint Africa, "D.O wasn't taking holidays. I was also aware of his stance on the COVID-19 vaccine. We are are both trained physicians and had had extensive conversations about the pandemic. The more egregious allegations about misappropriation of funds are easy to deal with via the proper channel of an independent audit. But accusations about waste of funds, especially on the trip to Ghana are, at the very least, misguided." At this point, on the intervention of his wife, D.O says he took a much needed vacation to avoid another health crisis. "By the time I returned, Gloopro had rejected a counteroffer and Amzat had tendered his resignation from the KloudCommerce board," D.O recalls. D.O's initial action was to restructure the board. The revamped board comprised Ogunremi, the Managing Director of Gloopro, and D.O serving as the chairman. This formation was in line with the original representation of SAFE investors, Gloopro, and the founder's interests. Subsequently, the board swiftly initiated a product audit to assess the current state of affairs. The audit's findings were grim, indicating that the situation had deteriorated to the point where shutting down the company was the only viable option. "As one of the top three investors, it was a difficult decision," Ogunremi recalls. "But it had become evident that not only could the co-founders not work together, but with the backlog of financial commitments, and the difficulty fundraising, we would continue to incur debt to the entity. The wisest thing to do at that stage was to stop the hemorrhaging." The decision to shut down was effected on the 30th of September, 2022 and all stakeholders were notified. "I think most investors had, by this stage, also come to the same conclusion because when meetings were called to discuss with the board, very few investors attended and there was no significant objection to it," recalls Ogunremi. "Following the company’s shutdown, my life just fell into this pitch darkness," D.O shares on the Twitter thread, "I withdrew from everything and everyone, which really alarmed my wife, such that I was put on a 24-hour suicide watch. I had lost interest in literally everything!" According to D.O, WeeTracker's report, released in October following the company's shutdown, predominantly reflected the viewpoints of Amzat and his COO. The situation remained quiet until March 2023, when TechCabal reported D.O's arrest by the EFCC. It was quite weird for me, reading about his arrest while receiving a call from D.O in person. TechCabal subsequently updated their article, confirming that D.O had been released the previous day, less than 24 hours after detention. D.O alleges that the entire ordeal was a calculated move, with the media being unwittingly used in the scheme. He asserts, "The petition was a fabrication. It was solely orchestrated and executed by Amzat." "I have since retained lawyers and have chosen and adopted the approach of using appropriate legal means to seek redress. In due season, I expect this to come to fruition," he concludes.
How this 25-year-old founder raised $11.6 million for his fintech startup Kennedy Ekezie may be 25, but he has lived a life only a few people dream of. At 19, he graduated from the University of Calabar with a Bachelors degree in Philosophy. As a student, he was a member of the debate team and founded a council to fight for women’s rights at 16. That earned him recognition in the form of the Queen’s Young Leaders Award and a Young African Leaders Initiative fellowship. Straight out of school in 2018, he joined Accenture, but soon left after landing a scholarship at Peking University, China. After two years in Beijing, he joined a social media upstart that was exploring expansion plans beyond China. That social media upstart was TikTok, and he was on the team that led its expansion into Africa. In 2021, along with his Co-founders, Duke Ekezie and Jephthah Uche, he started Kippa, a financial management startup for SMEs that has since raised more than $10 million, but a year earlier, the co-founders had come up with and discarded several business ideas before settling on Kippa. Settling on Kippa Lagos may be Nigeria and Africa’s startup capital, but it also has the highest cost of living in Nigeria. For a bunch of guys in their early twenties accustomed to certain standards, living in the city would burn a hole in their pockets, so they all decided to move to Uyo, a city in the Southern part of Nigeria. Without the expenses and distractions of Lagos, they hoped to come up with a great business idea. “Now that I talk about it, it sounds like it was a very logical thought-through process. But for us, it was a very easy decision. We audited about five cities. It wasn't going to be Lagos. It wasn't going to be Abuja. It definitely was not going to be Port Harcourt or Enugu and Uyo was the next best thing on that list.” In Uyo, they brainstormed different business ideas, including an online platform where people could lend out clothes they were not wearing. That business lasted less than 24 hours before they moved on. The idea they finally settled on was called Kippa, a financial management app for African SMEs. “We said we were going to travel across some of the commercial nerve centres in Nigeria to meet small businesses. We went to Aba and Lagos, spent a lot of time on the ground in Uyo, and went to Owerri, and for us, it was 'Let’s see how businesses work' and what problems they have that we can solve for them,” he said on a recent podcast. From spending time with the SMEs, they discovered that they all reconciled business accounts manually and figured they could digitise the process. There were also a few startups with similar models in places like Pakistan and India, and they sent messages to the founders and senior executives to learn how their businesses worked. Once, they gatecrashed an accounting seminar for small businesses to tell attendees they were building an app to automate their accounting processes. Insights from building a financial app for African SMEs There are 44 million micro, small, and medium enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa responsible for 80% of jobs in the region. However, these businesses typically do not use technology in their operations. A report by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation revealed that less than 7% of businesses in Africa used any form of technology. This is despite higher productivity, sales, and employees reported by those who do. But for Ekezie, when thinking of small businesses and their use of technology, a distinction must be made from how digitally savvy individuals would use technology. “Most small businesses use WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram to sell, to communicate with their suppliers and customers. That’s technology,” he said, “50, 70 years ago, it was not a foregone conclusion that businesses needed electricity to operate. But now no business can really work without that.” Ekezie’s thoughts echo the growth of social commerce in Africa. Since 2020 when the pandemic forced people indoors, more SMEs have taken advantage of social media to attract customers and sell their products. Ninety-two per cent of Kenyan SMEs leveraged social commerce (PDF) to drive sales, while the majority of eCommerce activities in Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Chad, and the Central African Republic were driven by social commerce (PDF). With more than 500,000 users, he insists that Kippa operates in a nascent market and has more room for growth. “While today their use of technology probably touches mostly suppliers and customers at the very minimal level, there's a lot of room for that to be deepened, and to build for the other stakeholders that they work with, but also bring all of those together. That's where we think the opportunity truly lies.” Build a great business and investors will come So much has changed about the fundraising process in the past two years. Frequent fundraising announcements have been replaced by the odd announcement. Still, many startup founders hope they’ll raise money from venture capitalists. With $11.6 million raised across two rounds, Ekezie has some experience raising venture capital, but he claims it was not an easy process. “The process in and of itself is challenging, especially if you're doing it for the first time. You don't know what to expect, and you don't know how long it's going to take. There's just a lot of unknowns, and for me, and I would say most founders who like to have control over things, over processes, it's just too many variables that are outside your hand.” Initially, the team tried to raise some money, but when that didn’t work out, they focused on building Kippa. They soon started seeing traction and attracted the attention of some investors. Ekezie credits this to something he heard Shola Akinlade, Co-founder and CEO of Paystack, say. “I heard this from Shola of Paystack; as a founder, your job is to build your company, to build your business, and the investor’s job is to find you. I think it's cliche, but things are cliche for a reason because [they're] so deeply true." Although he didn't have a smooth fundraising process, Ekezie says he has no regrets about how the process turned out and sees them as necessary mistakes. "A lot of the mistakes were process and tactical mistakes. Structuring the round, for example, saying yes before getting feedback from everyone you've spoken to. So it was just some of those tactical errors that most people make during initial rounds of fundraising." Quizzed on the qualities he'll look for in an ideal investor, he says they must be able to contribute to subsequent fundraises and help founders the way they want to be helped. "I feel like the averagely good investor is the one who sends capital and just shuts up after that, so for everyone who does anything else, spends time on a monthly or quarterly basis with you, that's above average. The best investors learn [how they can be valuable to you] without you telling them through interactions with you and plug those gaps by themselves." Structuring mutually beneficial partnerships Two heads, they say, are better than one, and in business, two businesses are often better than one. However, many businesses that get into partnerships do not realise the gains they hope for. Ekezie advises founders considering partnerships to evaluate whether the partnership creates value for the business or its customers. "Every partnership exists to solve a problem that we've pre-identified, and we're not as opportunistic with our partnerships. There's a very clear need, and we spell it out." Considering how deeply entrenched SMEs are in the African economy, there's a consensus that startups building tools for this segment will see significant success. But with many startups entering the space, there's the danger of too many players competing for a small pie and making it harder to have any clear winners. However, Ekezie holds a different opinion. "When you look at it, all startups are running different experiments. There's definitely no clear winner yet. I do not think we're at the point where competition can kill any startup. All of the startups that have shut down did not shut down because of competition, and we're not going to see any startups that would die because of competition over the next 10 years." As we rounded up our conversation, I asked Ekezie what his tips are for first-time founders, and his first was choosing the right team. "Everyone says this, but it's so important that the team you hire, especially the first few people who join the team that you pay a lot of attention to them. Spend a lot of time before you make those decisions, and when you bring them in, try to keep them as long as possible." Business decisions can often be high-stakes decisions, and he explains that founders are better off making them quickly. "Make decisions quickly no matter how difficult they are. You may be wrong, but even if you're wrong, you've integrated some sort of new knowledge into your knowledge structure, and that way you can make decisions faster when you encounter similar situations." Finally, he adds that founders must learn how to manage bad news and failure. "The journey is definitely non-linear, and you have to get very good at communicating bad news to yourself, to your employees, to all other stakeholders and not allowing that [to] debilitate you."
Founded by an ex-Amazon employee, Powerfull wants to help solar asset financiers mitigate risk Energy costs are some of the most significant for any business. But while many entrepreneurs globally primarily depend on a national grid, Nigerian entrepreneurs often use their national grid as a backup. Such is the poor state of the country's electricity sector that the acronym of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), the now-defunct body responsible for coordinating electricity in the country, was renamed "Never Expect Power Always." A 2022 report revealed that over 40% of Nigerian households own and use generators, spending $14 billion annually on petrol and diesel. Businesses are not left out either, with those in the manufacturing sector spending as much as ₦‎144 billion in 2022 to generate power. Despite the unreliability of the national grid, many businesses can't turn to alternative sources of energy to keep their businesses running. Solar panels, for example, come with a high setup cost that often discourages potential users. Nigeria's low credit penetration also ensures businesses struggle to access loans to buy solar assets. Over the past few years, some organisations have attempted to solve some of these problems. MTN provided solar financing options through a partnership with Lumos, while Access Bank provides up to ₦‎50 million for solar financing. Startups like SunFi, which recently raised $2.3 million in seed funding, also play in the space. But there's a crucial part of the equation that often prevents financial institutions from providing finance — credit and risk assessment. How do you ensure timely loan repayment? Powerfull, a startup founded by former Amazon employee, Ifeanyi Ukwuoma, hopes to fix this problem. Men lie, women lie, numbers don't Despite graduating with good grades from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), with a Geology and Earth Science degree, Ukwuoma struggled to secure any jobs for a year. Distraught, he focused his energy on getting a scholarship to study abroad, eventually landing an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. In his first year, he took courses in the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Poland, and Hungary. For the second year, he opted to complete his studies at the University of Exeter and Delft University of Technology. After graduating, he took up a role as a supply chain coordinator at STX Engine before moving to Amazon two years later. Back in Nigeria, Ukwuoma's mother, who ran a small cold room, was searching for a solution to the epileptic power supply. However, she couldn't afford to pay upfront for a solar panel, and none of the financial institutions she visited were willing to finance the purchase. "I remember speaking with one of them, and he kept on saying, high risk, so I replied, 'When you say high risk, what do you mean?' and he gave me a list of things. She's not a registered business. She doesn't have a long operating history. She hasn't stayed in a particular place for a number of years. We don't know her cash flow and we don't know how much energy she's using.'" Since he'd been helping her organise her business for a few months, he proffered an answer to those questions, but the financier quipped, "men lie, women lie, data doesn't." Recognising that the lenders' reluctance stemmed partially from their inability to assess a borrower's potential, he teamed up with Mayowa Abiodun to start Powerfull. Abiodun, who leads the startup's technology efforts, previously worked at Momas Electricity Meters Manufacturing Company Limited (MEMMCOL), and has experience building payment systems. Unlocking solar financing using Powerfull It's easy to assume that Powerfull provides solar financing to its customers, but Ukwuoma is quick to shut down that notion. He insists that it facilitates the distribution and collection of loans using a smart meter, smart wallet, and mobile app. While the mobile app measures energy usage, the smart wallet monitors repayment compliance and can be triggered to disconnect a user from the energy source. This way, it acts as a payment platform for energy companies. An important metric is how effective they are at ensuring debts are paid. Its primary business model targets businesses. For this vertical, a business in need of solar asset financing, purchases a smart meter from Powerfull, which is installed on the solar asset they wish to purchase. The meter calculates how much energy they consume, providing lenders with data they can use to make a decision. The minimum duration for this is three months, but can be longer depending on a lender's requirements. By understanding how much a business spends on its energy needs, a lender can provide them with a commensurate lending period and interest rate. On the other hand, knowing their energy needs ensures businesses get the right solar assets. There's also an energy-as-a-service option for businesses that want to use solar energy, but are unwilling to buy the solar assets. These users can buy electricity units just like users of the national grid, but their access can be cut off remotely once they run out of electricity units. Currently, Powerfull works with credit partners who refer prospective borrowers to them. These borrowers are then educated on the need for Powerfull's meters before picking them up. Ukwuoma says the startup takes as much as two weeks to educate prospective customers to ensure they understand the implications of acquiring the meters. There's an extra layer of security to prevent vandalism or customers increasing energy consumption. All meters installed by Powerfull are tamper-proof and are designed to turn off power supply immediately they are opened. It also provides data that can be used to determine whether a customer is using more or less energy than they subscribed for. When this is detected, a team of trained personnel goes to the location for an assessment, as its setup prevents unqualified personnel from fixing any damages. Powerfull charges users a 7.5% fee for processing loan repayments, while the smart meter starts retailing from ₦100,000. While some may baulk at the price, Ukwuoma says that it helps Powerfull and the lenders determine which businesses are committed to making the transition to solar energy. Compared to the 1.5% most fintech startups charge, its 7.5% fee is significantly higher, but Ukwuoma explains that it helps the startup cover its cloud storage costs. While the primary focus is on businesses, Ukwuoma explains that they have a B2C component. Here, customers can download the Powerfull app to purchase electricity units. Given its strong B2B focus, Powerfull is big on partnerships with solar asset financiers or solar asset producers. So far, it has closed partnerships with Blue Camel and Neotropical Technology. It also uses Steamaco's API services for its smart meters. Funding and challenges Although Powerfull has been primarily self-funded since its launch, the startup has received some funding from Startupbootcamp. Additionally, it is preparing to raise a £350,000 pre-seed round in 2023. "We want to be able to deploy around £48 million in terms of credit funding to solar asset financing. At the same time, get us to £75,000 monthly recurring revenue in 18 months." He states that one of the biggest challenges they've encountered centres around educating people on the benefits of switching to solar power. With the initial cost significantly higher than installing a diesel generator, many businesses often opt to continue with what they're used to. Acknowledging that more time would be needed to drive the massive adoption of alternative energy sources, Ukwuoma explains that it informs their decision to target large businesses and mini-grids as this allows them to make money while simultaneously driving awareness. Another challenge has been energy management. Using the example of a prospective client who had an old refrigerator, he pointed out that many Nigerians use appliances that consume large amounts of electricity and are incompatible with solar solutions. "If there's anything I've learned so far, [it's that] the poor people pay more for electricity in Nigeria. Our data shows it. They're using very energy inefficient stuff and our data shows that it accounts for 40% to 60% of the energy costs that people get." Currently operating in Lagos, Nigeria, Powerfull plans to expand to Abuja and Port Harcourt in the coming months, before moving outside Nigeria where it would compete with well-established companies like Sun King and Zola Electric.
Nigeria's competition regulator delists 28 loan apps from the Google Play Store Hey guys, Ogheneruemu here. Yesterday, Bolu filled in for Victoria because she was under the weather. As you can probably already tell, she still is and I'm covering for her today. Please send her your wishes; she'll definitely see them. ID verification company, Smile Identity has launched a no-code identity verification tool, Smile Links. It is a customisable solution that enables businesses generate a shareable identity verification flow complete with their name, logo, and data privacy policy in a few minutes. Meanwhile, Bolu was watching the Apple event yesterday and I asked him if there was anything new. Here's what he said: the iPhone 15 is basically a clone of the iPhone 14 pro but with a USB C charging port and a 48 MP camera, new Apple watches, and all-day battery life. Bolu is curious about how Apple wants to gate keep its ecosystem away from other USB C charging cables. Me, I don't really care; you should ask Bolu for an article, though. Here's what I've got for you today: 28 loan apps delisted in Nigeria Lipa Later's debt funding 28 loan apps delisted in Nigeria Nigeria's Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has delisted more loan apps from the Google Play Store. The number increased from 9 to 37 and some of the delisted apps include: Swiftkash, Hen Credit Loan, Cash Door, Eaglecash, Luckyloan Personal Loan The Commission also disclosed that the number of fully approved loan apps has increased to 164 from 154, while apps with conditional approval have decreased slightly from 40 to 38. Apps on their watch list have moved from 20 to 56. In the last three years, the FCCPC has ramped up efforts to protect consumers from fraudulent loan apps. In March 2022, it stormed the offices of GoCash, OKash, EasyCredit, Kashkash, Speedy Choice, Easy Moni, and Sokoloan. Google's May 2023 update to its Personal Loans policy for apps on the Play Store has seen it restrict these apps from accessing users’ sensitive information like photos, external storage, videos, contacts, precise location, and call logs. Lipa Later's debt funding Kenyan fintech, Lipa Later has announced the closure of a KSh 500 million ($3.4M) privately placed debt issuance. The raise was supported by Rubicon Landing as transaction advisors and KN Law as legal advisors. Eric Muli, Lipa Later CEO, says the funds "have enabled us to further invest in technology and infrastructure to make our financing solutions even more accessible and convenient for our customers." The 5-year old buy now, pay later startup has previously raised $12 million in pre-Series A funding in a bid to expand to new markets. It is also currently exploring a crowdfunding option to raise $1.2M, and has so far received more than $27,000 from a pool of 29 investors. The company says it plans to raise an additional KSh 2 Billion in equity and debt to spur its growth further as it works "towards unlocking a $500bn financial inclusion opportunity in urban Africa."

Inside Moniepoint's gamified, offline strategy for retail banking and financial inclusion in Nigeria In a quiet estate on the outskirts of Lagos, Tunji, a small-time electronic shop owner, completes a sale with a blue PoS device in his hands. He’s one of the 1.6 million businesses that have found an efficient digital sales funnel with Moniepoint’s platform. After winning in agency and business banking, Moniepoint is setting its sights on individuals, aiming to redefine financial inclusion in Nigeria. Financial inclusion? Yeah, I can feel you rolling your eyes, and I understand. In 2020, McKinsey declared something increasingly obvious — Fintechs are merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Nigeria. The figures do not lie. Per Intelpoint’s 2022 financial services market report, over 66 million Nigerians, aged 15 and above, do not have a bank account. This means 55% of Nigerians older than 15 are excluded from the financial sector. This sounds huge, but when placed in context, a higher percentage (45%) of Nigeria’s teenage to adult population is financially included compared to other populous African countries. While most fintechs have largely served people with smartphones or those already in the banking sector, some Nigerian commercial banks and agency banks like Paga, Moniepoint, and OPay, are pushing financial inclusion to the frontiers. Interestingly, the Central Bank of Nigeria has set an ambitious target: 95% financial inclusion by 2024. While some of its more recent policies have seemed counterintuitive to this target, companies that didn’t fold are innovating regardless. Moniepoint, buoyed by its success in the agency banking game and in serving over 1.6 million organisations, is stepping into the personal banking arena. But they're not just offering another banking service; they're aiming to provide "financial happiness," according to Babatunde Olofin, the Acting Managing Director of Moniepoint MFB. Read more about their foray into personal banking here. The company has a strategy for everyone. The banked, or unbanked, those with or without access to smartphones Financial inclusion with Smartphones and beyond Smartphone ownership is a significant indicator of financial inclusion. Intelpoint's report reveals that people with smartphones or smart feature phones are more likely to own a bank or mobile money account. Roughly 30 million Nigerians aged 15 and above have access to the Internet, and Moniepoint is looking to capture this demographic with what it believes to be a winning strategy. “We realize that if you want to drive behavioural change and increase adoption, you should reward consistently good behaviour,” says Ope Adeyemi, Senior Vice President, Channels and Sales tools, Moniepoint. The company rewards consumers with coins on the personal banking app after they carry out transactions. These coins allow them to take part in exciting weekly games such as Shuffle and Spin the Wheel. This gamified approach could see users win ₦2,000 weekly and a grand prize of ₦10 million. Some of Moniepoint’s competitors have also used similar rewards-based approaches to varying degrees of success. One such is the fintech company, OPay, which was one of the big winners of Nigeria’s cash crisis of January 2023. Intelpoint’s report survey shows that 83% of respondents had accounts with just a commercial bank. The core focus for Adeyemi is on incentivising people to keep their money on the app and use it for their transactions. The executive eyes a scenario where people can now use a portable version of the Moniepoint PoS terminal to handle public bus rides (Danfo) in a city like Lagos. Nigerian startup, Touch n Pay (TAP), is already making forays in this area with NFC cards, so Moniepoint’s approach should be interesting to see. However, we can’t ignore the cockroach in the room. Taking it a step further Moniepoint is preaching the gospel of financial inclusion with its foray into retail banking. While the rewards-based model has its quirks, we can’t escape the fact that just 26% of Nigeria’s teen-adult population have access to the Internet. Nigeria’s young digital native population is promising, but we can’t ignore 66 million people outside of the digital space. Moniepoint’s agency banking strategy heavily relied on a massive offline network, and it would power this to the retail banking space. “We want to include everyone from the regular Okada rider, the market woman in the financial services space,” Olofin explains. "In nearly every corner of the country, we have representatives. Even in localities where there is no physical bank or ATM presence, you’ll find our precious blue boxes there.” Each agent is like a bank branch in their own right. Not to be confused with cash-in-cash-out PoS operators, they will be key to powering Moniepoint’s ambition to onboard 4.8 million retail customers in three months - three times its current customer base of businesses. While gamification is key to hooking smartphone users, Moniepoint’s agents will help those without phones open accounts and issue them cards for them to conduct transactions anywhere. “We have built our infrastructure in such a way that it is very elastic. As transactions grow, we can expand our infrastructure and this is because we have several monitoring tools that help us to monitor how transactions are growing.” It’s hard to bet against Moniepoint, considering their quiet dominance in the fintech market, but that’s just one part of the financial inclusion puzzle. Expanding the definition of financial inclusion Financial inclusion has often been reduced to mere bank account ownership. For the avoidance of doubt, bank account ownership is the entry point for financial inclusion, and it extends to important services like credit, insurance, pension, investment opportunities, remittances, and financial education/literacy. According to Intelpoint, only 31% of MSMEs have obtained loans, and a mere 2.1 million adults have insurance. Moniepoint, already processing a staggering 400 million transactions monthly valued at $12 billion (yes, a billion US dollars), has plans to extend its credit services to individuals. It's a lofty goal in a country where 42% of those without a bank or mobile money account earn less than ₦35,000, and nearly 29% are unemployed. The story so far for lending companies has been a mixed bag of success, sordid, and predatory among players like Carbon, Fairmoney, Kuda, Palmpay, and Sokoloan. Some experts like Lendsqr's Adedeji Olowe see unlocking access to credit as the key to unlocking prosperity for millions of Nigerians. Our best guess is there have to be more developments on the credit fronts before it fully rolls out credits for individuals. The bigger picture: A continental financial inclusion play Moniepoint's ambitions are not just national but continental. "We're not just a bank; we're a movement towards financial happiness across the continent," Olofin adds cautiously. This isn't mere rhetoric; Moniepoint recently acquired Kenyan company Kopo Kopo, signalling its continental ambitions. Read more about the acquisition here. By understanding the nuances of the Nigerian market, Moniepoint is poised to make financial inclusion a lived reality for millions. Whether it's Tunji in her Lagos market stall or a Danfo driver navigating the city's chaotic streets, Moniepoint's vision is clear: financial inclusion is a right, not a privilege.
CBN backs Swap, Flutterwave's answer to Nigeria's FX problems The news: Flutterwave has launched Swap, a product to digitise access to FX for Nigerians. Swap was launched in partnership with Wema Bank and Kadavra. Flutterwave said Swap users will be issued cards that can be used for personal travel allowance or business travel allowance. Swap, which was announced on September 4, 2023, in Ikoyi, Lagos, is backed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN) as the digital platform for Nigerians to have immediate access to foreign currency at competitive exchange rates. The product will work with the aid of Wema and Kadavra — a bureau de change (BDC) — that will provide it with liquidity and foreign exchange. Flutterwave's CEO, Olugbenga Agboola said, that Swap is the answer to the pain points and challenges individuals and businesses go through when trying to access FX. Nigeria has been facing multiple FX problems in recent years. One of these is $10 billion in FX backlog, which the CBN plans to clear in two weeks. The backlog includes dollar requests from manufacturers and importers, business travel allowance, personal travel allowance, and medical bills abroad. Interestingly, commercial banks control 75% of forex transactions in the country, and the launch of Flutterwave's Swap could be a way to reduce the dependence on banks for FX. Flutterwave said Swap will also start rolling out cards that can be used by Nigerians who need quick access to personal travel allowance and business travel allowance. It said it plans to distribute more than 10 million cards to Nigerians starting in October this year.
Telecom operators reject NCC's requirement Flutterwave has partnered with an Indian bank, IndusInd, to launch its remittance service, Send App, in the Asian country. The collaboration will allow anyone using Flutterwave to transfer funds from India to the 30 African nations where the fintech company operates. “The Indian expansion for Flutterwave will be the first African company to do this at scale where remittances from India to Africa become seamless and quick,” Olugbenga Agboola, Co-founder and CEO of Flutterwave, said. He also stated that the fintech will seek additional partners to expand its presence in India. This news comes just a few weeks after the CEO announced that the company would proceed with its IPO plans. Here's what I've got for you today: American Towers Corporation to take over MTN's Nigerian towers Wetility's $48m funding Telecom operators reject NCC's requirement American Towers Corporation to take over MTN's Nigerian towers The Nigerian subsidiary of the American Towers Corporation (ATC) will take over MTN Group’s tower operations in Nigeria from IHS Holding, a telecom infrastructure provider, starting 2025. After reviewing the bids submitted for the tower contract, the telco said it chose ATC as the preferred tower company for those sites based on its superior offer. MTN said it was proactively negotiating its tower contracts in Nigeria because the leases for about 2,500 of its network sites in Nigeria — for which IHS provided services — would expire in 2024 and 2025. In 2022, IHS acquired over 5,700 MTN tower sites in South Africa through a sale-and-leaseback agreement. However, since then, their relationship has deteriorated. MTN is embroiled in a shareholder dispute with the tower company. The South African telco accused IHS Towers of wilfully violating its shareholders' agreement in June 2023. MTN owns 26% of IHS Towers but only 20% of the voting rights, which it cannot sell. But it wanted its stake in the company to reflect its voting power. This new agreement may impact IHS Tower's revenue because Nigeria is its largest market in revenue and sales, with MTN accounting for a large portion of those sales. Telecom operators reject NCC's requirement The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)'s corporate governance requirement that licencees obtain written approval from it before they can repatriate funds has been rejected by telecom operators in the country. Several businesses, including IHS Nigeria, American Towers Corporation (ATC) Nigeria, and Airtel Nigeria, claim that the requirement would discourage investments. Repatriation of funds guarantees that foreign investors receive their investment's return, especially when the licensee's investors are primarily foreign. However, waiting for NCC approval before repatriating funds will cause investor dissatisfaction and disrupt the company's operations. So, ATC Nigeria recommends obtaining NCC approval where the repatriation involves a significant amount that could jeopardise the company's operations. “The repatriation threshold that would require the approval of NCC be fixed at 80%,” it says. Moreover, IHS Nigeria said the failure to make timely interest payments also portends ill for the nation because lenders will be hesitant to give local borrowers more credit. Over time, this could impact sovereign credit ratings, because, depending on the capital structure of the entities, foreign shareholders and bondholders are entitled to receive dividends and interest, respectively. The regulator says it has received all of their submissions and would address them in its ongoing review. Wetility's $48m funding South African solar fintech company, Wetility, announced $48m (R903m) to grow its customer base in the country and fuel its expansion. The fundraise includes debt totalling $9.4m (R180m) in convertible debt and $31.3m (R600m) in commercial debt from Sanlam and other commercial and development banks. Founded by Vincent Maposa in 2019, Wetility provides homes and businesses with solar energy solutions. Its flagship product is a comprehensive digital solar energy management system that enables users to control power consumption remotely. The startup uses solar energy to provide customers with hybrid energy options that integrate with their power systems. Wetility says it offers each customer a customised 360 Wetility experience, enabling them to connect, interact, and develop as needed and at the right time. The energy provider collaborates with several corporations, including Standard Bank, Sunflower Energy Africa, The Innovation Hub, Sasfin, Investec, Experian, Multichoice, and Instructured Capital Solutions. Wetility offers financing options, like monthly payment plans, allowing it to reach a market segment of consumers who would otherwise be unable or hesitant to invest in solar equipment upfront.

This intro isn't complete with the podcast. So, on this week's episode of Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discussed AltSchool's expansion to provide jobs for 10,000,000 African youth, the Acting CBN Governor assuring foreign investors that FX backlog will be paid in 1-2 weeks, and Worldcoin token owners losing money. Watch it here. Here's what I've got for you today: ₦120 billion debt cleared Nestcoin gets $1.9m for Onboard Nigeria partners India to grow its edtech sector ₦120 billion debt cleared The outstanding ₦120 billion debt owed by banks for the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) provided by telecom operators has been supposedly resolved. Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), announced this yesterday at the Telecom Executives and Regulators Forum (TERF). After the Acting Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Folashodun Shonubi, intervened, Danbatta said the banks had agreed to pay off the accumulated debt and continue to pay for the USSD service going forward under the corporate billing term. He claimed that the realisation that telecom services are necessary for financial inclusion led to the resolution's success. As of August 2023, telcos were supposedly considering a payment plan proposed by the banks. In May 2023, the NCC granted mobile telcos in the country — MTN, Glo, Airtel, and 9mobile — the approval to disconnect banks from using USSDs. If Nigerian banks did not settle their debts, the telcos threatened to stop providing the service. Nestcoin gets $1.9m for Onboard After raising $6.45m in 2022, Nestcoin has received $1.9m in strategic funding led by Hashed Emergent. Other investors like Adaverse, Base Ecosystem Fund, Alter Global, CMT Digital, Magic Fund, and 4DX Ventures, participated in the round. The company, which lost a significant portion of its previous funding in November 2022 due to the FTX crash, plans to use the fund to strengthen its balance sheet and accelerate the growth of its new product, Onboard. Onboard is a non-custodial crypto wallet with the benefits of a custodial wallet. Its focus on Onboard is a pivot from Nestcoin's initial mission, an incubator — a company with several crypto products that also invested in other crypto/Web3 companies. Its mission for Onboard is to provide universal access to world-class financial services. It wants to simplify the use of crypto for the uninitiated, and its next milestone fits into this mission. The company plans to launch "Onboard Virtual Cards, a service that will allow Onboard users to spend their crypto as easily as cash, making both online and in-store payments possible across more than 160 countries." What's more, this strategic investment comes at a time when crypto/Web3 startups are reeling from a severe crypto winter in which numerous crypto companies have shut down. Nigeria partners India to grow its edtech sector Yesterday, Bosun Tijani, Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, disclosed that he signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. This move will accelerate Nigeria's digital transformation and support the edtech industry. The partnership will allow for the exchange of innovative digital solutions and expertise to improve the educational landscape in both countries. Why does it matter? The edtech industry in India has exploded in the last few years, making it the world's epicentre. The public sector is a facilitator, while the private sector assumes a pivotal role. One report shows that India is the world's second-largest e-learning market after the US, with a market value of $6 billion projected to reach $10 billion by 2025. What’s more, Tijani also signed a second Memorandum of Understanding with India’s edtech company, Central Square Foundation, to support Nigeria's Edtech ecosystem.

Ghana lost $4.32m in six months to cyber fraud Zoom is changing the name of its generative AI assistant, formerly known as Zoom IQ, to AI Companion. It is also expanding the accessibility of AI Companion across the Zoom platform, including Zoom Whiteboard, Zoom Team Chat, and Zoom Mail. Zoom will add a conversational interface in 2024 that allows users to chat directly with the AI companion to ask questions about meetings and chats. The AI Companion would create and submit support tickets, draft answers to questions, and catch them up on meetings they had missed or arrived late for by summarising meetings, highlighting key points, and recommending action items. Here's what I've got for you today: Ghana lost $4.32m in six months to cyber fraud Itana's $2m pre-seed Sama to hire over 2K Kenyans Ghana lost $4.32m in six months to cyber fraud Between January and June 2023, cyber fraud activities cost Ghana $4.32 million (GH¢49.5m) in direct financial losses. Director-General of the Cyber Security Authority (CSA), Albert Antwi-Boasiako, stated that the number only represented a portion of the cases reported to government organisations. Meanwhile, financial losses arising from unreported cases could be greater than those announced so far. He mentioned that the Authority received 41,285 contacts from members of the public between October 2019 and July 2023 of complaints about cybercrime and other related activities. Identity theft, online extortion, romance fraud, and shopping fraud accounted for 41% of the total. Antwi-Boasiako made this announcement on Sunday at the Accra media launch for this year's National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which will take place in October. He emphasised that the country needs to do more to educate young people about cybersecurity issues. Itana's $2m pre-seed Itana (formerly Talent City) has raised a $2 million pre-seed from several investors, including Future Africa, LocalGlobe, Amplo and Pronomos Capital. Itana, founded by Luqman Edu, Iyin Aboyeji, and Coco Liu, is positioned to become Africa's first digital free zone. What are free zones? They are designated areas within a country where goods and services can be traded with unique tax and customs benefits. The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) and the Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority (OGEFZA) manage Nigeria's 17 free zones. These free zones include the Calabar Free Trade Zone, Kano Free Trade Zone, Lekki Free Trade Zone, and Ladol Logistic Free Zone. They are located throughout the country and provide several benefits to businesses, including tax incentives, duty-free imports, and streamlined regulatory processes. So, Itana plans to create a virtual city in these free zones for companies in the service and digital industries while providing the same advantages. It aims to improve Nigeria's ease-of-doing-business index, spur foreign direct investment (FDI), and increase employment. The project's initial iteration is Itana Edge, a one-stop online shop similar to major global tech products. Foreign companies that do not have a physical presence in a Nigerian free trade zone can use it to gain access to incentives such as taxation, business visas, banking, capital repatriation, and supportive legislation after incorporating and operating there. Itana plans to go live in the first quarter of 2024 and will start its pilot in Nigeria with a few select businesses in the coming weeks. Sama to hire over 2,000 Kenyans What comes to mind when you stumble on the word "Sama"? Meta, right? You should understand what I’m saying if you’ve been reading Techpoint Digest this past year. I told you in January 2023 that Sama, formerly Meta's content moderation service provider, declared it would stop working with the tech giant and shut down its regional hub by March 2023. Following the firing of about 200 content moderators earlier this year, there have been scathing reports of employee abuse and the misapplication of labour laws. This news isn't about the Sama-Meta case, though. What now then? Sama, which has since evolved into a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company, has announced that it will begin hiring 600 Kenyans this week for roles in computer vision artificial intelligence. The business, which offers AI training services to Fortune 500 clients based in the US and other customers, will hire an additional 1,500 Kenyans to scale up job creation in the BPO sector. Computer vision AI is a subset of AI that enables computers to comprehend digital pictures and videos before giving instructions. The Kenyan government has recently pushed for the launch of more ICT hubs to provide employment opportunities for the youth. “The Government is committed to securing these 2,500 jobs by Sama as we race to formulate the necessary policies and regulations to accelerate the growth of players in the BPO sector,” ICT Principal Secretary, John Tanui, said. In case you missed it Inconsistent reporting, lack of clarity, vague performance metrics: African investors share their biggest frustrations with startup investor updates Clickafix, backed by Fast Forward Ventures, aims to fix Nigeria's home service gap with ₦24,000 yearly subscriptions What I'm reading and watching YouTube is experimenting with longer but less frequent ad breaks on TV Iranian women reject hijabs despite morality police return Why you CAN’T Leave an Abusive Relationship
Clickafix, backed by Fast Forward Ventures, aims to fix Nigeria's home service gap with ₦24,000 yearly subscriptions Nigeria's home service industry is hard. Companies like VConnect, KeyaHelp, and Findworka, have tried to proffer tech solutions but have either failed or pivoted to something else. However, Clickafix, backed by venture studio, Fast Forward, is taking another stab at the market with a different business model. The model is a ₦24,000 ($31.65) subscription that covers repairs for a year. It addresses three problems that come with getting the right person to provide home services. "One, is how do you find dependable artisans. Second, getting down to negotiate the price. The third is the convenience and ease with which you can get an artisan," said Pawan Bhandari, who co-founded the company alongside Arusha Goswami. Bhandari explained that the ₦24,000 subscription, only covers workmanship and in cases where materials are needed, a separate payment is made. The company gives you two options: buying the materials yourself or requesting a ballpark figure of what it should cost. Marketplaces are not sustainable Early tech solutions in Nigeria's home service industry were either an online directory for artisans or a marketplace that connected customers and artisans. While these solutions provide you with potential service providers, vetting them and reaching a reasonable price is a herculean task. However, emerging players like Eden Life and Clickafix have come up with new solutions. Eden Life, which launched in 2019 to digitise home services, also uses a subscription-based model but with less diverse services (Clickafix offers plumbing, electrical work, HVAC services, carpentry, and fixing kitchen appliances) and an average monthly fee of ₦42,000. Clickafix's lower price is a competitive advantage, however, this subscription-based model does not eliminate the challenges that come with formalising Africa's informal home service industry. One of them is verifying that the service providers on Clickafix are qualified. Clickafix has what you can describe as a three-factor authentication model to ensure that service providers on the platform are up to standard. The startup has a partnership with eight technical colleges in Lagos, chosen based on the quality of the college and the trainers. Selected service providers move to the second stage of authentication — background checks. These checks involve verifying the service provider's identity and the provision of a guarantor — whose details would also be vetted by Clickafix — by the service provider. The third stage is a 10-hour soft skill training by Clickafix Academy. This session trains the service provider on dealing with customers appropriately and general workplace ethics. So far, the three-factor authentication system has worked well for the company as Bhandari reveals that service providers barely have issues with customers. Beyond that, however, he believes how service providers are treated has a significant effect on their performance. "We treat them as partners rather than looking at them as a vendor," he said. "If you treat people with respect, they will remain within your ecosystem." While mutual respect keeps service providers happy, Clickafix still has its hands full trying to win the trust of Nigerian customers. "It takes time for a customer to do two things: trust a company and change their buying behaviour. This is not a service bought on impulse. It is not like going on Jumia to buy one shoe and you see three other shoes and end up buying three pairs of shoes. It is a very need-based service." When it's a need-based service, customer acquisition takes longer, Bhandari reveals. He said constant communication with the customer is required when running a need-based service. How does Clickafix make money from a ₦24,000 yearly subscription? From lengthy customer acquisition time to constant communication, how does Clickafix make money on a ₦24,000 annual subscription? Although Bhandari says it's a trade secret, he only revealed that Clickafix's business model is using economies of scale to ensure that it makes money and the service providers are duly compensated. The startup's unique business model is one of the reasons why Fast Forward — a venture studio with the likes of Bumpa, Chimoney, and Dojah on its portfolio — is backing it. "We've seen many companies try and fail to crack the home services space in Nigeria. What makes Clickafix truly unique is the strength of the team and their deep understanding of the challenge," said Opeyemi Awoyemi, General Partner at Fast Forward Venture Studio. Bhandari also added that beyond the investment Fast Forward brings to the startup, the venture studio also understands its challenges and shares the passion of bringing some structure to an otherwise informal market. Launched in 2022, Bhandari's dream for the startup is to scale outside Africa and outlive the founding team. While he did not share traction figures on account that the company is in its early stages, the Clickafix app currently has over 10,000 downloads on the Google Play Store. This number could soar as Clickafix is also adding a B2B2C model that'll see it onboard companies that need its solution. These businesses can in turn provide it as a benefit to their employees. While the new players in Nigeria's home service market are looking to disrupt the space with unique business models, a true sign of success is yet to be seen. Clickafix's success is dependent on its economies of scale, but if we assume that all 10,000 people who downloaded the app on Google Play Store are subscribed — which is highly improbable — that's a ₦240 million ($316,452) yearly revenue, but will it cover operational costs?
Inconsistent reporting, lack of clarity, vague performance metrics: African investors share their biggest frustrations with startup investor updates Earlier this month, Editi Effiong, filmmaker, and founder of Anakle Films, made a post about sending 50 investor update emails while filming The Blackbook. Among the responses were three from Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, Jasiel Martin-Odoom, and Oo Nwoye, who stressed the importance of founders sending investor updates. The post was yet another reminder of the value investors place on getting regular updates from portfolio companies. According to a new report by PR firm, Wimbart, 71% of African investors receive consistent reports from their portfolio companies, with all investors surveyed stating that they consider investor updates a major priority. For these investors, regular updates influenced their willingness to provide follow-on funding and their perception of the startup’s leadership. Commenting on the report, Aina explained that consistent investor updates signal that a founder is accountable, an important factor when deciding which startup to write a cheque to. "When startups regularly share their progress, challenges, and achievements, they are demonstrating a genuine commitment to transparency with investors. This reporting is also critical to keeping investors engaged and excited to help the company navigate challenges. In Africa, especially, this credibility can serve as a crucial differentiator for investors seeking the most promising companies," he said. But while most investors reported receiving regular updates from portfolio companies, it appears they are unsatisfied with the quality of the reports, and highlighted common mistakes founders make. Diligence Africa wants to help African startups and investors make smarter investment decisions A lack of clarity and focus was one of the major problems highlighted. One investor disclosing the content of an investor report shared that it read more like a sales pitch than an investor report. Startups also shared lengthy reports but failed to provide sufficient information. Vague performance metrics were also a common theme. Financial and operational KPIs were rated as the most important metrics for investors, with sustainability metrics also listed. Investors stated a desire to understand how the startup was doing in terms of revenue growth, customer acquisition, and product milestones. They also stated they would want to see negative and positive developments, and encouraged founders to identify ways they could help. The report stresses the importance of consistent timelines for investor updates. All investors surveyed reported that they would prefer monthly reports, but only 64% currently receive monthly reports, while 29.4% receive quarterly reports, and 5.9% receive bi-monthly reports. When asked to rank five factors in order of importance, the consistency and reliability of the information presented ranked highest. Brevity ranked lower than comprehensiveness, indicating a willingness to read longer reports provided they contain vital information.
Itana gets $2m pre-seed to establish Africa's first digital free zone Itana (previously Talent City) has raised a $2 million pre-seed from several investors, including Future Africa, LocalGlobe, Amplo and Pronomos Capital. The funding will help the startup raise Nigeria's ease-of-doing-business index, spur foreign direct investment (FDI), and increase employment. Itana, founded by Luqman Edu, Iyin Aboyeji, and Coco Liu, is positioned to become Africa's first digital free zone. Free zones are designated areas within a country where goods and services can be traded with unique tax and customs benefits. The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) and the Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority (OGEFZA) manage Nigeria's 17 free zones. These free zones are located throughout the country and provide several benefits to businesses, including tax incentives, duty-free imports, and streamlined regulatory processes. Edu said Itana plans to create a virtual city in these free zones for companies in the service and digital industries while providing the same advantages. The project's initial iteration is Itana Edge, a one-stop online shop akin to major global tech products. Foreign companies that do not have a physical presence in a Nigerian free zone can use it to gain access to benefits such as taxation, business visas, banking, capital repatriation, and supportive legislation after incorporating and operating there. The Nigerian government, which grants business licences, collaborates with Itana to offer these services. Itana intends to expand the number of services it offers for companies to operate remotely and, leveraging the anticipated success of its Lagos project, partner with other African governments to replicate physical and digital free zones in their markets. Itana plans to go live in the first quarter of 2024 and will start its pilot in Nigeria with a few select businesses in the coming weeks. These businesses will access Itana District, a 72,000 square metre "live-work-build" campus. It will host long-term residents and online community visitors for social events, co-working, and co-living. It will finish the first stage of its development by 2027.
Catalyst Fund reaches the first close of its $40m fund Rentoza has raised $6 million to extend its pay-per-use subscription model for renting electronic goods outside South Africa. It will also use the funds to support the company's innovation plans. Alitheia IDF led the investment round, and the Vumela Enterprise Development Fund participated. 2017 saw the launch of the regional online subscription service. It follows the same subscription business model as Netflix, Apple Music, and Microsoft, allowing users to pay a monthly fee to access services they otherwise could not afford. The company offers several products, including mobile devices, tablets, and laptops, and household appliances, such as refrigerators, microwaves, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners. Here's what I've got for you today: Amazon's answer to Starlink to provide 5G in remote Africa Catalyst Fund reaches the first close of its $40m fund Alex Okosi is Google in Africa's MD Amazon's answer to Starlink to provide 5G in remote Africa Vodafone has announced plans to use Amazon's imminent satellite service, Project Kuiper, to provide 4G and 5G connectivity to remote areas in Europe and Africa. Through a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), Amazon's Project Kuiper aims to improve global broadband access. Its goal is to bring fast, affordable broadband to unserved and underserved communities globally. Vodafone’s subsidiary, Vodacom, announced that it would replace the need for fixed wireless or fibre-based connections by using high-bandwidth, low-latency satellites from Starlink’s rival, Project Kuiper, to connect mobile base stations in remote locations to its core networks. Cellular antennas will receive bandwidth from Project Kuiper, enabling customers in the area to receive 4G or 5G reception. It stated that it would specifically target areas where traditional fibre or microwave backhaul connections would be difficult and prohibitively expensive to serve. Amazon is preparing to test two prototype satellites before the 2024 launch of its network, which will go up against Elon Musk's Starlink, OneWeb, and other providers. Vodafone, Vodacom, and Project Kuiper will begin rolling out services in Africa and Europe as soon as Amazon's production satellites go live. Catalyst Fund reaches the first close of its $40m fund BFA Global's Catalyst Fund has reached its first close, raising $8.6 million of the $40 million it hoped to secure for investments in African climate startups. FSD Africa Investments (FSDAi), Cisco Foundation, USAID Prosper Africa, and Andrew Bredenkamp participated. The Catalyst Fund's primary goal is to assist climate-focused startups in expanding across the African continent. However, it intends to invest in other sectors, including agritech, insurtech, climate fintech. This also includes startups focused on fishery management, food systems, cold chain logistics, waste management, and water resource management. So far, it has supported ten startups from six countries, including Egypt, Senegal, and Morocco. In 2023, Catalyst Fund intends to fund 20 startups and 40 over the next few years. Pre-seed companies will receive a $200,000 investment, followed by $500,000 rounds up to seed and $1.5 million series A rounds. The Catalyst Fund was established in 2016 as a pre-seed accelerator to help startups with issues like access to capital, talent, and markets. It accomplished this through charitable collaborations with groups like the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. During the accelerator programme, 61 startups, including Turaco, Wasoko, Cowrywise, and FarMart, in 15 emerging markets were supported. However, in 2022, it transitioned from an accelerator to a venture capital fund. Alex Okosi is Google in Africa's MD Google has appointed Alex Okosi as Managing Director for Google in Africa. Before this, he was the Managing Director for YouTube's Emerging Markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Before joining YouTube, he served as the Executive Vice President and Managing Director of BET International and Viacom International Media Networks Africa. Okosi significantly contributed to the development and growth of the platform in Turkey, the Middle East, and Africa in his most recent role at YouTube. Okosi will oversee Google's operations in Africa in his new position. These include programmes to help African businesses and economies grow, expand access, and provide tools to help several users get more out of the Internet. Meir Brand, Vice President of Google's EMEA Emerging Markets, said Okosi is a recognised leader with in-depth expertise in the media and technology industries and is passionate about using technology to empower individuals and organisations. He also has a thorough understanding of African nations. In case you missed it Kotani Pay receives a $2m pre-seed to support offline cross-border crypto payments in Africa Beyond tech, AltSchool Africa wants to empower the next wave of creative economy and business talent This startup is building an Airbnb for parking lots in Africa's busiest cities Some of the faces at the Nigerian Fintech Executive Mixer hosted by Intelpoint What I'm reading and watching Sam Altman-backed Mentra aims to match neurodivergent jobseekers with ideal jobs “I Was Born With An Extra Chromosome” When did Persia become Iran?
Beyond tech, AltSchool Africa wants to empower the next wave of creative economy and business talent Between 2020 when I did an analysis of the education technology landscape in Nigeria and now, it has experienced significant transformation. While the challenge was once how tertiary learning wasn't getting enough attention like primary and secondary education, more talent development platforms have sprung up to double down on helping learners build careers in rapidly growing sectors, essentially filling the gaps left by the traditional education systems. In this evolving landscape, AltSchool Africa has become a notable player. The latest update from the skill-to-market platform is its expansion to include Creative Economy and Business Schools. The 2-year-long journey In 2021, the startup embarked on the mission to help students learn and gain recognised diploma certificates in sought-after careers within a year. Since then, it has successfully graduated pioneer sets for the School of Engineering and School of Product, with the first cohort of the School of Data currently in progress. Notably, this expansion comes less than two years after the startup secured $1 million in pre-seed funding. Meanwhile, the decision to broaden its faculties was partly influenced by the remarkable 40% completion rate it recorded in the past year. While the online learning market has experienced the influx of courses especially after 2020, dropout rates have consistently increased pegging the average completion rate at a meagre 14%. These dwindling stats are due to several factors including learning engagement, course quality, flexibility, and quality of assessment. The startup boasts of having a unique approach to online education, and this has been instrumental in addressing these shortcomings. AltSchool Africa co-founder and CEO, Adewale Yusuf explains what the company did right. “Our goal is to create a fun and communal learning platform for all Africans to develop their skills, regardless of their previous education or background. Our unique teaching methods have proven successful in helping our learners better retain information, demonstrating that we understand the complexities of how online education works," Yusuf disclosed in a statement confirming the expansion. AltSchool Africa partners OpenLabs Ghana in daring play to democratise access to globally relevant learning in Africa Why the creative industry? In a chat with Nifemi Akinwamide, the startup's Head of Growth and Partnerships, he clarified the startup's motivation for the expansion and corrected a possible misconception that it points to a shift in the startup's core model. "Talent has always been our core, and it was not just tech talent. We started out with something we are familiar with, which is tech. But the goal has always been to ensure we take 10 million Africans to their next level in terms of career paths and give them financial prosperity without keeping them in the 'tech' bubble, but make them employable by both tech and non-tech companies." He added that this commitment led the company to delve into another branch of the rapidly growing creator economy industry, including music. Under the new vertical, the school offers students short courses in content creation, sales, and music business to earn certificates in six weeks. This is necessary to bridge the gap in the African talent space, especially as universities are not particularly preparing students for what the job market requires. In hindsight, this move has possibly been on the horizon since the startup announced its pre-seed raise in 2021; two music artists participated in the round. Coincidentally, one of them is part of the faculty. Oiling the wheel To support this expansion, AltSchool Africa has enlisted prominent figures from the African creator space as facilitators. In addition to media personality, Oladotun Ojuolape Kayode (Do2dtun) who was hired as its Creator Relations Director in August, popular Nigerian artist, Folarin Falana (Falzthebahdguy) is also a facilitator in the School of Creative Economy. Joining them for the content creation courses are other influential content creators and experts, such as Adebowale Adedayo (Mr. Macaroni), Nigerian film director, Nora Awolowo, music journalist, Joey Akan, and health content creator, Chinonso Egemba (Aproko Doctor). Akinwamide explained that this new vertical will exist in a model similar to other faculties -- where students learn through materials on an online learning platform, attend live classes and also build a community for the learners. To ensure the quality of education is preserved, AltSchool Africa made another strategic hire some months ago from the University of Texas, Dr. Ademola Akinrinola, the Director of Curriculum and Learning Experience Design. His role involves shaping curriculum, grading system, projects, and overall learning experiences for students. While these facilitators might not have a background in academia, Akinwamide shared that they possess invaluable firsthand knowledge of the creative industry -- an essential quality needed for grooming market-ready individuals. AltSchool Africa's new verticals are priced at $100 and are designed as six-week short courses different from the existing 12-month courses in the Schools of Engineering, Product, and Data that charge $30 per month. Akinwamide believes that will be instrumental in making the learning path flexible and accessible. The startup also plans to offer career services, guiding students toward becoming independent experts and connecting them with companies in need of their expertise. Notably, these courses cater to both beginners and those seeking to upskill, going beyond music to include sales and business courses that are needed in various industries. There's also the possibility of introducing short courses for the existing schools. Interested learners can visit the AltSchool Africa official website to access detailed information about each course, including prerequisites, course content, and faculty details. Following global standards AltSchool Africa's newest move is, however, not surprising. One of the world's most valuable online learning platforms, Coursera, originally started out by offering online courses from top universities in technology and computer science. Influenced by the understanding of market demands and interests, it has expanded its course catalogue to include a wide range of subjects beyond tech, including courses in business, arts and humanities, health, and many other non-tech disciplines. Interestingly, this has aided Coursera's success as it allowed the platform to reach millions of learners globally and cater for various career choices. This expansion model aligns with AltSchool Africa's approach to providing a wide array of educational opportunities to meet the evolving needs of learners beyond traditional tech-focused education. While the company has high hopes for this expansion, it seeks to keep evolving to meet the needs of African talent, because, as Akinwamide put it, "we are in the business of people."
Kotani Pay receives a $2m pre-seed to support offline cross-border crypto payments in Africa Kotani Pay, a Kenyan-based fintech startup, has raised a $2 million pre-seed funding round to expand into Rwanda, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, and Nigeria. P1 Ventures led the round, with participation from DCG/Luno and Flori Ventures. Founded in 2020 by Brian Kimotho, Daniel Kimotho, Felix Macharia, Samuel Kariuki, and Stephen Kiarie, Kotani Pay is a crypto payments startup that aims to make cross-border remittances easier for Africa's underbanked population. The use case it focuses on affects the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people, including those in Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, and South Africa. Kotani suggests using blockchain to make remittances to Africa easier. It uses stablecoins — cryptocurrencies linked to fiat money like the USD — to send money abroad for a fraction of the cost of more conventional methods. With the help of the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) communication protocol, Kotani has created a middleware that links blockchains to regional payment networks. Many of these networks enable users to send money using feature phones without an internet connection. Kotani is offering its technologies as a B2B solution, connecting crypto platforms’ smart contracts on the one side and mobile money APIs on the other. Some of its major crypto partners include Yellowcard, DCG, Fonbank, Celo’s Valora, Mercy Corps, UNICEF Crypto Innovation Fund and Stellar. Additionally, Kotani users can "on-ramp" or convert their home currencies into US dollars; this feature is currently more geared towards businesses but could be available to retail users if they obtain the required licences. Kotani makes money by charging an interchange fee, which amounts to about 1% of the gross transaction volumes. Inbound payments account for $23 million of all transfers made on Kotani to date. The platform's average transaction size is $150,000 because it focuses on businesses.
Amazon's Starlink rival, Project Kuiper, to provide 5G in remote Africa Vodafone and Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite constellation, Project Kuiper, have collaborated to bring 4G and 5G services to more underserved customers in Europe and Africa via the latter's high-bandwidth, low-latency satellite network. Vodacom, a subsidiary of Vodafone, announced that it would replace the need for fixed wireless or fibre-based connections by using high-bandwidth, low-latency satellites from Starlink’s rival, Project Kuiper, to connect mobile base stations in remote locations to its core networks. It stated that it would specifically target areas where traditional fibre or microwave backhaul connections would be difficult and prohibitively expensive to serve. Without spending time and money installing fixed wireless or fibre-based links back to the core networks, Vodafone and Vodacom will offer 4G and 5G services in more locations. Amazon is preparing to test two prototype satellites before the 2024 launch of its network, which will go up against Elon Musk's Starlink, OneWeb, and other providers. As soon as Amazon's production satellites go live, Vodafone, Vodacom, and Project Kuiper will start rolling out services in Africa and Europe. Additionally, Amazon and Vodafone are looking into more enterprise-specific products like connectivity extensions for distant infrastructure and backup services for unplanned events. Amazon anticipates beginning a small-scale beta test of Project Kuiper services by the end of 2024, and Vodafone and Vodacom intend to participate in that testing through this partnership. Project Kuiper and Starlink are two initiatives that aim to increase global broadband access through a constellation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Starlink, unlike Project Kuiper, is a satellite Internet constellation. Project Kuiper has secured 77 heavy-lift launches from Arianespace, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance, with additional launches from Blue Origin available, providing enough capacity to deploy the majority of its satellite constellation. Starlink, on the other hand, has already launched over 5,000 satellites into orbit. It aims to offer high-speed Internet access to remote areas globally. German telco, T-Mobile, plans to use the Starlink network to increase coverage in dead zones, and SpaceX is enticing other mobile service providers to connect their networks to space. Meanwhile, in July 2023, a Kenyan telco, Safaricom, announced plans to launch satellite Internet services to compete with SpaceX, a US-based space exploration company, preparing to launch its offering, Starlink, in the country. The telco will collaborate with AST SpaceMobile, a Starlink competitor, to offer this service.
This startup is building an Airbnb for parking lots in Africa's busiest cities Driving in Lagos is not for the faint-hearted. The sheer amount of traffic jams can test the patience of even the most seasoned drivers, but finding a place to park is a different ball game entirely. The frustration that comes with driving in Lagos is what made Philip Ogunaike, build Parkwell, a platform that helps you look for the safest parking spots around your destination. An Airbnb for your vehicle, if you will. Like many drivers in Nigeria's commercial capital, Ogunaike had constantly soldiered through Lagos roads to get to where he needed to be, but one day he'd had enough. "It was a journey that could have taken me eight minutes but I spent more than an hour," Ogunaike recalls. But the problem was beyond finding a suitable and safe place to park. He noticed that the challenge of finding a good parking spot also worsened traffic. Cars parked on both sides of streets made roads narrower with many at risk of getting sideswiped or even stolen. "Can't we make a platform that helps to identify parking spaces that are around wherever you go?" Ogunaike mused. Deciding it was possible, Parkwell launched operations in Lagos, Nigeria, in January 2023. How does Parkwell work? Parkwell works like e-hailing platforms and Airbnb. The mobile app interface displays a map of your current area and available parking spots. It also allows you to book spots ahead of time. Like Airbnb, you see pictures of the car park, rates charged, and reviews. Reviews are important to the platform because of its Airbnb element. This means that people with parking spaces in their homes or offices can make some money by registering it as a parking spot on Parkwell. Like e-hailing solutions, Parkwell has two platforms, one for users looking for parking spots and another for people who want to register their parking spaces on the platform. The platform for registering a space is called the Parkwell Partner. To be a Parkwell partner, you take a picture of the parking space you want to register, enter the address and lock it in with the platform's GPS. After this, Parkwell visits the space to verify that the person who registered the place own it and that it meets Parkwell's security standards. One safety precaution is insurance. The startup has insurance partners — Pay-U and Curacel — that provide per-minute comprehensive insurance for users. It also has an identity verification system that ensures a vehicle can only be picked up by whoever parked it. The business model If you register your front yard as a parking spot on Parkwell, for instance, the platform will demand a 30% commission of the fee someone pays you for parking. The same goes for gated parking lots, which Ogunaike defines as an area dedicated only to parking. However, dedicated parking lots come in different forms. Businesses like malls also have spaces just for parking, so how does Parkwell get such spaces registered on the platform? Although the platform is yet to register such places, Ogunaike gives an idea of the planned setup. "If Shoprite wants to deploy on Parkwell, for example, everyone who uses Parkwell will be able to see how many spaces are available. Once you book it, we'll reserve the space for you." Once a reservation has been made, you scan the check-in barcode when you arrive at the car park. Parkwell will calculate how much you owe based on the amount of time you spend in the space till you scan the check-out barcode. Since its launch, Parkwell has registered 80 parking lots with over 2,000 parking spaces in two African cities — Lagos, Nigeria and Dakar, Senegal — where solutions like Parkwell aren't very common. In Lagos, some of Ogunaike's competitors are the Lagos State Parking Authority (LASPA) and Parchive. Parchive was founded in 2020, but the app has only 100+ downloads on the Google Play Store, showing very little growth in the past three years. LASPA's parking solution, on the other hand, only provides you with information on parking locations across Lagos and their operating hours. Nevertheless, these solutions are competitors to Parkwell, but Ogunaike is more concerned about getting people to use the solution in Africa, something that has been a big challenge for the startup. "This is novel, especially in this part of Africa. Trust is one of our major challenges. People were doubtful of the solution when we first started." While earning people's trust has been difficult for the startup, Parkwell has been able to get 3,150 users to park in its over 2,000 parking spaces. Ogunaike reveals no revenue figures but says the company which just left Startupbootcamp AfriTech's accelerator is in the process of raising its pre-seed round. In the meantime, Parkwell is exploring partnerships, such as a park-and-ride initiative with bus and train stations that'll help people find parking spots while they go for a ride in a bus or train. With these partnerships, Parkwell is gunning for an ambitious 100,000 users by the end of 2023. Ogunaike admits that it's a lofty dream but with accolades such as earning a nomination for the Global Startup Awards Africa, he believes Parkwell is a solution people need as it makes parking one less thing to worry about when driving in congested cities.
Wasoko enters the Democratic Republic of Congo As former CEO, Yolisa Phahle, gets ready to retire, MultiChoice Group has named Marc Jury as the interim CEO of its Showmax division. Calvo Mawelo, CEO of MultiChoice Group, announced that Phahle will begin a handover process and Showmax will start reporting to Jury on September 1. She will give Jury full-time advisory support for six months. Jury, the CEO of MultiChoice South Africa, will serve in both capacities while MultiChoice looks for a replacement for Phahle at Showmax. Phahle will continue to consult for MultiChoice Group after the six-month handover process while reporting to Jury for a year starting in March 2024. Here's what I've got for you today: Wasoko enters the Democratic Republic of Congo Anchor gets $2.4m seed Kenya's CA advocates for alternative regulatory tools Wasoko enters the Democratic Republic of Congo After expanding into Zambia in May 2023, African eCommerce platform, Wasoko, has entered the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, is now part of Wasoko's expanded market reach for small businesses. Shop owners can access competitively priced products from manufacturers and distributors through Wasoko's mobile app and real-time tracking data on sales, business insights, and market trends. Wasoko, which debuted in 2016, claims it has addressed the supply chain inefficiencies that millions of small business owners in Africa's informal retail sector face. The company, which operates in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia, has over 220,000 informal retailers and has filled over 5 million orders. Wasoko entered Rwanda in 2019, and since then, its revenues have soared from $2 million in its first year of operation to $48 million in 2022. Given its success in Rwanda, Wasoko is equally optimistic about using its current infrastructure to support small business growth in the neighbouring DRC. Anchor gets $2.4m seed Anchor, a Nigerian fintech startup, has raised $2.4 million in seed funding after emerging from stealth in 2022 with $1 million in pre-seed funding. The funds will go towards expanding the company's product line. Goat Capital led the round, with participation from FoundersX, Rebel Fund, and some existing investors, including Y Combinator and Byld Ventures. Anchor is a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider that offers APIs, dashboards, and tools to help developers embed and build banking solutions. When Segun Adeyemi, Olamide Sobowale, and Gbekeloluwa Olufotebi launched Anchor, the fintech catered to only businesses. It helps them provide services, including payments, savings, and card issuance. Currently, Anchor's APIs support cross-border payments, business accounts, card issuance, bill payments, bulk disbursements, and developer-only features like an audit log system and developer webhooks. It collaborates with regulated banking institutions to assist companies in cutting the time it takes to develop banking products from years to days. It had 30 clients when it launched in 2022 but now has about 270 customers. Fintechs, SaaS companies, eCommerce companies or marketplaces, and other tech-enabled businesses are among its clients. The company has generated more than $550 million in annualised total transaction volume (TTV). While it makes money from processing fees, account and card issuance fees, and interest from the float, Anchor says revenue is increasing 30% month over month. Kenya's Communications Authority advocates for alternative regulatory tools Kenya's Communications Authority is advocating for the adoption of alternative regulatory tools to keep an eye on emerging technologies, including digital currencies, digital platforms, social media, and Over-the-top services. The Director-General of the CA, Ezra Chiloba, said the absence of a fully functional framework for digital currencies increases the risk of money laundering and compromises consumer protection. Chiloba made this statement while testifying before a National Assembly special committee. The purpose of the parliamentary committee was to look into the compliance of Worldcoin with the laws and regulations of its regional partners. Worldcoin is a cryptocurrency project that scans people's eyes to create a global financial database for humans. It collected Kenyans’ biometric information by taking pictures of their irises in exchange for KSh 7,000 ($50) or 25 World tokens. On August 2, 2023, Kenya's Ministry of Interior and National Administration suspended the activities of Worldcoin. Three days later, the law enforcement officers raided a warehouse on Mombasa Road in Nairobi and seized equipment they believed contained data gathered by Worldcoin. Following that, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) sued to prohibit Worldcoin from transferring or processing data collected from Kenyans. Consequently, the Worldcoin saga has drawn attention to regulatory shortcomings, such as the lack of a fully operational framework for virtual currencies. According to Chiloba, the expansion of the digital economy necessitates striking the right balance between regulation and innovation support. He stated that the CA has created a regulatory sandbox to foster innovation, inform regulatory decisions, and promote socioeconomic growth. Regulatory sandboxes serve as an alternative to conventional regulatory tools and give users access to real-time testing of current digital technology goods and services, providing vital information for understanding novel technologies.

This startup has raised $12m to distribute renewable energy in Africa with AI The news: Australia-based Okra Solar has raised $12 million to provide electricity in Africa with its mesh-grid system. The Series A funding round was led by At One Ventures, with participation from other investors. The company plans to use the funding to propel its mesh-grid technology and electrify rural areas. Okra Solar's $12 million Series A is made up of a $7.8 million equity round led by At One Ventures with participation from other investors such as FMO, Susquehanna Private Equity Investments LLLP, the Autodesk Foundation, and King Philanthropies. The debt funding was provided by EDFi. Okra Solar wants to use the funding to propel its mesh-grid technology, that distributes technology among households with artificial intelligence. The mesh-grid technology solves the problem of scalability when it comes to efficient power distribution. How does Okra Solar's mesh-grid technology work? When Solar power is generated in someone's home, the mesh-grid technology allows excess power to be redistributed through Okra Solar's smart algorithms. The mesh grids enable the distribution of power from a source that is already close to multiple sources instead of generating power from a central source and distributing it over long distances. According to the company, distributing power over short distances among neighbouring homes cuts the cost of electricity distribution by 90%. Launched in 2016, Okra Solar operates a B2B model that supplies the technology to last-mile energy utilities, who then use it to supply power to last-mile households. The technology has already been deployed in four countries and is serving 14,000 people. “In Nigeria, our technology has been approved for subsidies from a $550 million fund put together by the World Bank, African Development Bank, and the Rural Electrification Agency. CEO, Afnan Hannan, told Business Day.

After emerging from stealth with $1m, Anchor gets $2.4m seed funding to broaden its product offerings Nigerian fintech startup, Anchor, has revealed a $2.4 million seed investment after coming out of stealth in 2022 with $1 million in pre-seed funding. The company will use the funds to broaden its product offerings. Goat Capital led the round, with participation from FoundersX, Rebel Fund, and some existing investors, including Y Combinator and Byld Ventures. Anchor is a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider that offers APIs, dashboards, and tools to help developers embed and build banking solutions. It competes with JUMO, Maplerad, OnePipe, and Bloc. When Segun Adeyemi, Olamide Sobowale, and Gbekeloluwa Olufotebi launched Anchor, the fintech caters to only customer accounts. It helps businesses provide services, including payments, savings, and card issuance. Currently, Anchor's APIs support cross-border payments, business accounts, card issuance, bill payments, bulk disbursements, and developer-only features like an audit log system and developer webhooks. It collaborates with regulated banking institutions to assist companies in cutting the time it takes to develop banking products from years to days. It had 30 clients when it emerged from stealth in 2022 but now has about 270 customers, with about 63 companies active on the platform and online. Fintechs, SaaS companies, eCommerce companies or marketplaces, and other tech-enabled businesses are among its clients. These startups include Pennee, SeamlessHR, Bujeti, LifeBank, and Waza. The company has generated more than $550 million in annualised total transaction volume (TTV) by offering fintech services to these businesses. While the company makes money from processing fees, account and card issuance fees, and interest from the float, Anchor says revenue is increasing 30% month over month.

Kenya partners Spiro to deploy electric bikes Pitch Friday is this Friday, September 8, 2023. Will you attend? You don’t want to miss it if you are an entrepreneur or an aspirant like me. I look forward to this because Uche Ukonu will share how he bootstrapped Smallchopsng to ₦100 million in revenue with only 9 employees. He'll also talk on lessons you can apply to your startup. This should be a paid event, but we are handing it to you for free. I’m not shouting, but don’t miss it for anything! It will begin at 3 p.m. WAT at Zone Tech Park, Gbagada, Lagos State, Nigeria. To attend, register here. Here's what I've got for you today: Kenya partners Spiro to launch electric bikes M-PESA to launch standing orders Kenya partners Spiro to launch electric bikes Last Friday, the Kenyan government announced a partnership with Spiro, an African producer of electric motorbikes, to introduce electric bikes across the country. Since its launch in 2019 by Jules Samain, Spiro has manufactured nearly 10,000 electric bikes and has operations in nations like Benin, Togo, Rwanda, and Uganda. Over 5,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions have been avoided by these EVs' combined 90 million km of green travel. The company has developed an infrastructure for renewable energy, with about 350 battery swapping and charging stations set up throughout Africa. Spiro plans to add an additional 3,000 battery charging and swapping stations as part of this new agreement with Kenya to enhance the country's EV infrastructure. “With our batteries and locally produced energy in Kenya, we diminish the dependence on fossil fuels, fast-tracking Kenya’s journey towards energy independence,” Samain noted. This happened a day after Uber launched an 80-kilometre-range electric motorbike, One Electric, in Kenya. Additionally, Spiro plans to establish a manufacturing base in Kenya to generate thousands of job opportunities, along with the construction of charging stations and the hiring of service personnel. M-PESA to launch standing orders M-PESA plans to launch standing orders for users. This move will make it the first mobile money platform to offer its users this choice. What are standing orders? A standing order is a way to use your bank account to make payments automatically. It is you setting up a rule with your bank to have them regularly pay a certain sum of money to someone else. For instance, you can set up a standing order to transfer money from your account to your savings account automatically if you want to save money every month. Alternatively, you can set it up to automatically pay your phone bill monthly. Kenyans can use this feature to set up recurring payments for online subscriptions, like Showmax and Netflix. Due to the widespread use of M-PESA for rent payments, this feature might make it simpler. They can also repay their outstanding loans to M-Shwari, Hustler Fund, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) M-PESA, and other mobile loan platforms. However, Safaricom hasn't specified when the feature will be available or how it will work. This also includes how to set up accounts, obtain authorisation, and even secure it.

Uche Ukonu bootstrapped his startup to ₦100m. Now, he wants to show you how you can do it too At this month's edition of Pitch Friday, Uche Ukonu, will be sharing how he bootstrapoed Smallchopsng to ₦100m revenue, with just 9 employees, and lessons you can apply to your startup. Register here to attend. Techpoint Pitch Friday is hosted in partnership with the Hague Institute for Innovation of Law. If you read tech publications before 2022, you'd be forgiven for thinking that venture capital was the only funding source available to technology companies. But that's not the case. Some of the most prominent investors globally typically invest in less than 4% of the startups that pitch to them. If you doubt me, check out this statement attributed to Marc Andreessen of a16z fame. "We can do maybe 15 or 20 investments out of the 3,000 a year. So I like to say our day job is crushing entrepreneurs’ hopes and dreams. Our main skill is saying no, and getting people to not hate us." I think you get the point now. Fortunately, there are other funding options available to technology entrepreneurs. One of those is bootstrapping. Next month, we'll be hosting Uche Ukonu, the founder of Smallchopsng. A little background story. After leaving Covenant University, he started Smallchopsng because he wanted to eat small chops. But without venture capital, he has grown the business to over ₦‎100 million in revenue. You can read all about him here. How this startup made ₦100m selling small chops online, with just 9 employees He'll be sharing lessons from that experience as well as the strategies he employed, so keep a date with us. Date: September 8, 2023. Time: 3pm. Venue: Zone Tech Park, Gbagada Expressway. Register to attend or pitch your startup here. Techpoint Pitch Friday is hosted in partnership with the Hague Institute for Innovation of Law.

Ugandan fintech, Asaak, acquires Mexican startup Happy September! When did we scream Happy New Year? Dear reader, time flies! Can we all promise to have fun this month, regardless of work? Last month was fantastic; I tried to go out every weekend. Trust me, it was relaxing for me. This weekend, please go out with someone — a crush, a friend, an acquaintance, or a partner. By the way, I appreciate you reading Techpoint Digest regularly. You’re the best. On this week’s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial discussed interesting stories, including X's plans to create a fintech product, Nigeria's search for AI policy researchers, and Anambra State implementing zero charges for Right of Way. Listen here. Here's what I've got for you today: Ugandan fintech, Asaak, acquires a Mexican startup MTN Nigeria raises ₦125 billion Uber launches electric motorbike in Kenya Ugandan fintech, Asaak, acquires a Mexican startup Asaak, a Ugandan fintech company, has expanded into Latin America by acquiring FlexClub, a Mexican startup, for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition will allow Asaak to build on its credit ecosystem by collaborating with the FlexClub Mexico staff to launch creative financial solutions specifically for the Latin American region. FlexClub provides car financing for Uber drivers and software that allows South African car rental companies to offer drivers vehicle "subscriptions." Through this agreement, the Ugandan mobility fintech will also introduce its credit solutions in Mexico, making it easier for employees to access affordable credit. Tinashe Ruzane, CEO and Co-founder of FlexClub announced that the company is exiting the Mexican market due to the challenging economic climate and the need for increased focus. Javier Serrano, FlexClub (now Asaak Mexico) General Manager, assisted in creating the group and its portfolio from the ground up. Founded in 2016 by Kaivan Sattar (CEO and Founder), Asaak offered motorcycle and smartphone loans to Ugandans individually and through partners like SafeBoda. “The vehicle is the entry point into our credit ecosystem, from which drivers can eventually access additional credit for fuel, repairs, smartphones or other needs they may have. We’ve proven this can be done profitably at scale for our clients, both online and in person,” Sattar said. Uber launches electric motorbike in Kenya Uber has launched an 80-kilometre-range electric motorbike, One Electric, in Kenya. Why? Frans Hiemstra, Director and Regional General Manager of Uber for the Middle East and Africa, said the launch aids the company's efforts to achieve a zero-emissions platform by 2040. E-mobility company, Greenwheels Africa, will manage all bike-related logistical matters, including maintenance and charging. Imran Manji, Uber's Head of East Africa, said Greenwheels currently runs a few charging stations in Kenya, and they intend to increase that number to ten before the end of the year. However, riders will not be responsible for charging their bikes. Instead, they will use the Greenwheels Africa stations to swap old batteries for new ones. The bikes will initially only be available in certain parts of Nairobi, with plans to expand to other Kenyan cities later. This coincides with Kenya’s launch of the National Electric Mobility Plan, which aims to develop a more environmentally friendly transportation network and introduce several initiatives for long-term sustainable road traffic management. MTN Nigeria raises ₦125 billion MTN Nigeria has raised ₦125 billion ($161 million) by issuing series 6 and 7 commercial paper notes to increase the company's funding options. What are commercial paper notes? They are a type of short-term loan that banks or corporations use to borrow money for a brief period, typically less than a year. They use this cash to cover expenses, including salaries, bills, and other costs. So, MTN Nigeria will use the funds to meet immediate short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper notes are typically issued for a short time (a few weeks or months) and are repaid when they mature. They are referred to as "unsecured" loans because they lack collateral. The telco issued 265-day and 181-day commercial papers with an issue date of August 23, 2023, and yields of 13.50% and 13.50%, respectively. In a statement, “MTN Nigeria sought to raise ₦100 billion, and the offer recorded 146% subscription with ₦125 billion issued across both series. This represents the largest aggregate CP issuance within a calendar year by any corporation in Nigeria’s debt capital markets.” Sidebar: In March 2023, MTN Nigeria raised ₦125 billion by issuing series 4 and 5 commercial papers to meet its short-term funding and working capital needs.

South African regulator finds Rain's ad misleading By 2025, the Federal Government hopes to have trained 1 million Nigerians in technical skills. This is consistent with President Bola Tinubu's promise to generate 1 million jobs in the tech industry during his first 24 months in office. In his campaign manifesto, Tinubu outlined his plans for job creation. In addition to supporting Nigerian youths who are already working in the tech sector, he would introduce intervention programmes in the ICT sector and other crucial areas of the Nigerian economy where the use of new technologies can hasten business growth and diversification. Here's what I've got for you today: Airtel Uganda to raise $216m in IPO South Africa's regulator finds Rain's ad misleading Airtel Uganda to raise $216m in IPO Remember this? Airtel Uganda plans to go public The telco has disclosed the details of its initial public offering (IPO). It plans to raise USh 800 billion ($216 million) by selling 8 billion ordinary shares, or 20% of its equity, on the Main Investment Market Segment to fund its expansion plans. The company informed the Uganda Securities Exchange that the price for its IPO will be USh 100 per share. It will also give retailers five shares for every 100 they purchase. Manoj Murali, Managing Director of Airtel Uganda, stated that the IPO allows Ugandan investors, including customers, to own a stake in the company and participate in its future growth. The IPO's principal sponsoring broker is Crested Capital, and its lead transaction adviser is Absa Bank Uganda Ltd. Murali announced that the 8 billion share offering would start on August 30, 2023, and end on October 13, 2023. Per the prospectus, the IPO's results will be revealed on October 30, and the company will start trading on the Uganda Stock Exchange the following day, on October 31, 2023. The telco, which has 14.3 million active subscribers spread across 146 districts in Uganda, will become the second telecommunications company listed on the Ugandan stock exchange, following MTN Uganda which was listed in December 2021. South African regulator finds Rain's ad misleading The Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB) declared that Rain, a South African mobile communications company, deceived its customers in an advertisement. What’s the ad? The promotion reads, “Join now for just 1 Rand. Unlimited 5G home wifi + FREE monthly calls and data for 2 phones. Offer available until 31 July 2023. T’s & C’s apply.” Trevor Hill, the complainant, argued that the advertisement misleads consumers into believing they can get unlimited 5G home WiFi and free monthly calls and data for two phones for R1. However, clicking on the ad takes customers to Rain's website, where the deal is R559 and a R1 joining fee applies. Consequently, Hill said that because only the R1 joining fee is advertised rather than the product's actual price, the customer is misled into thinking the product is only R1. What did Rain say? Rain said the promotional period for the 5G home WiFi deal had already expired and highlighted the deal’s terms and conditions. The telco stated that participants will pay an R1 joining fee if they purchase a Rain One product through the promotion. A monthly subscription fee will then be charged, with the justification that the advertisement is clearly for Rain One, only applies to the joining cost, and is subject to terms and conditions. What’s the regulator's verdict? The ARB considered Rain's response and the complaint under Clause 4.2.1 of Section II of the Code of Advertising Practice. The clause states that advertisements should not contain any statement or visual presentation that, directly or by implication, omission, ambiguity, inaccuracy, exaggerated claim, or other means, is likely to mislead the consumer. Even though the advertisement included the typical "T&Cs apply" disclaimer, the ARB decided that the wording was deceptive.

You might soon be able to send and receive money on X, formerly Twitter Key takeaways X, formerly Twitter, has gotten money transmitter licences in seven US states. The licence allows the platform to run as a money service business (MSB), facilitating cross-border transactions. This could be part of Elon Musk's plan to make X an everything app. On October 4, 2022, Elon Musk posted "Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app." He proved this when he changed Twitter to X nine months later. Now it seems enabling financial transactions is the first phase of transforming X into the everything app. Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 4, 2022 According to Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS), — a system that helps regulate mortgage lending in the US — X now has a money transmitter licence across seven states in the US, with Rhode Island being the latest. It got the money transmitter in Rhode Island on Monday, August 28, 2023. What does a money transmitter licence mean? In Rhode Island, businesses that require a money transmitter licence are those that are "transmitting money for its customers, including traditional wire transfers (like Western Union) and electronic transfers (like PayPal)." A money transmitter licence means X is a money service business (MSB) just like Stripe, a US fintech company that facilitates global payments. Companies with this licence act as intermediaries between individuals or businesses that need to move money across borders. What will X do with the licence? While X hasn't indicated what it will be doing with the licence, it can now allow people to send and receive money across the seven states — Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island — where it has received the money transmitter licence. It can also become a crypto exchange The money transmitter licence also allows X to operate a crypto wallet business. In Rhode Island, the license covers "the activity of “maintaining control of… transactions in virtual currency” “on behalf of others.” This includes businesses that control virtual currency transactions between customers. Such businesses may be commonly referred to as crypto-currency exchange platforms and/ or peer-to-peer exchangers." Making X a crypto exchange or crypto payments platform could be in the works for X. Musk has unequivocally declared his interest in cryptocurrencies several times on the X. Dogecoin is the people’s crypto— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021 The Tesla billionaire had a choke hold on the crypto market in 2021, influencing market prices with his tweets. His “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” post, sent the price of Dogecoin — his favourite cryptocurrency — up by 30%. His electric car company, Tesla, is reportedly holding 9,720 bitcoins and some Dogecoins. Now that X has the licence to run a crypto exchange and an MSB, a finance feature could be coming to the platform soon, but will it give it an edge over competitors?
Airtel Uganda to raise $216 million by selling 8 billion ordinary shares to fund its expansion plans Airtel Uganda disclosed the details of its initial public offering (IPO) two weeks after announcing plans to sell its shares to the general public on the Uganda Securities Exchange. By selling 8 billion ordinary shares, or 20% of its equity, on the Main Investment Market Segment, Airtel Uganda hopes to raise USh 800 billion ($216 million) to fund its expansion plans. The company informed the Uganda Securities Exchange that the price for its IPO will be USh 100 per share. It will also give retailers five shares for every 100 they purchase. The telco will sell common shares as part of the IPO and receive the net proceeds of the offering after deducting costs. Manoj Murali, Managing Director of Airtel Uganda, stated that the IPO allows Ugandan investors, including customers, to own a stake in the company and participate in its future growth. The IPO's principal sponsoring broker is Crested Capital, and its lead transaction adviser is Absa Bank Uganda Ltd. Airtel received a one-year extension after its inability to list its shares by December last year. So, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) gave a deadline of December 16, 2023, to fulfil the requirement. The IPO complies with regulatory demands that the company list by then. Murali announced that the 8 billion share offering would start on August 30, 2023, and end on October 13, 2023. Per a prospectus, the IPO's results will be revealed on October 30, and the company will start trading on the Uganda Stock Exchange the following day, on October 31, 2023. The telco, which has 14.3 million active subscribers spread across 146 districts in Uganda, will become the second telecommunications company listed on the Ugandan stock exchange once its listing is complete, following MTN Uganda, which is majority-owned by the South African MTN Group and was listed in December 2021.
Uganda to help over 12,000 farmers AI-driven policy tracking platform, Plural, has announced its entry into Nigeria and South Africa to provide access to public policy data. Plural's public policy data enables users to track and influence policy changes essential for accelerating economic growth and making sound business decisions. Plural began collaborating with the Nigerian social networking service AfriLabs in June 2023 for its pilot programme to improve the platform and advance the region's political change. It also wanted to help with regulatory simplification, ongoing digital transformation, transparency promotion, and cross-border business growth. Here's what I've got for you today: SeekMake gets over $537K from Lafayette Twiga Foods' share of the Hustler Fund Uganda to help over 12,000 farmers SeekMake gets over $537K from Lafayette Tunisian construction tech startup, SeekMake, has received $539K from Lafayette Group to support its international expansion plans. This is Lafayette Group's first investment in a Tunisian or foreign startup. Founded in 2018 by Adel Ayari and Zino Adidi, SeekMake is a digital platform that matches clients with construction and manufacturing companies across 40 countries. It allows for rapid concept generation and subsequent delivery of finished products. The startup says it provides several long-lasting, strong, and affordable materials. Aside from expanding into new markets, it has also experienced internal growth. Its team grew from four to thirty employees in just eight months. SeekMake has reached several milestones, including establishing partnerships with 72 manufacturers, expanding into 40 countries, and amassing a user and manufacturer base of over 10,000. SeekMake has established a subsidiary in Estonia as part of its expansion strategy. It boasts a diverse client base in Tunisia, the United States, and Australia. The company plans to use these funds to expand into new markets, primarily in France and Germany, because it says they present valuable opportunities for collaboration with major clients and partners. Twiga Foods' share of the Hustler Fund In November 2022, the Kenyan government announced that Twiga Foods, a B2B eCommerce startup, would receive funding for future lending to suppliers and customers. The fund is part of the KSh 50 billion Hustler Fund, which the government launched in December 2022. The Hustler Fund offers loans to micro, small, and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) that find it challenging to obtain financing from banks in Kenya. However, Twiga has revealed that no supplier has received the Hustler Fund of KSh 300 million fund. Why? Twiga's CEO and co-founder, Peter Njonjo, claimed it was due to a delay in creating the framework for allocating the funds. While Twiga was not to be a recipient of the fund, the company plans to help its customers access the loans for their businesses through our platform. Njonjo points out that since the launch of its Sokoloan platform, the startup has collaborated with other financial institutions to lend KSh 3.2 billionn to over 33,000 customers. This news comes just a few days after I told you that the Hustler Fund has a higher rate of loan defaults than commercial banks, SACCOS, and other financial institutions. Sidebar: Two weeks ago, Twiga Foods reduced its headcount by about 283 staff — one-third — of its 850 permanent employees due to challenging market conditions. Uganda to help over 12,000 farmers The East African Grain Council (EAGC) has started a climate adaptation project in Uganda to help over 12,000 smallholder farmers increase the sustainability of the food production system through irrigation technology and climate adaptation practices. Gerald Masila, the Executive Director of the EAGC, stated that additional beneficiaries will include commercial project partners who supply irrigation equipment, youths who will gain skills in operating and maintaining irrigation systems, and traders, including exporters, who gain access to produce for sale. EACG (Uganda), Grundfos (Denmark), Akvo International (Uganda), and Access to Innovation (Denmark) will carry out the three-year project with assistance from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as part of the DANIDA Green Business Partnership Programme (DGBP). Why does it matter? The scope of climate change's effects is unprecedented; they range from changing weather patterns that endanger food production to rising sea levels that increase the likelihood of catastrophic flooding. Future adaptation to these effects will be more expensive and difficult without immediate action today. Drought, heat waves, flooding, increase in pests and plant diseases, and decreased crop yields and nutritional quality could all result from climate change's effects on agriculture. The impacts of climate change make it more difficult for agriculture to provide for human needs. So, how will the project work? The project will investigate the provision of water from rivers, dams, or lakes to supplement when there is irregular or insufficient rainfall, primarily for producing high-value crops such as cereals and horticulture. Masila claimed that the project, which will also establish a supply chain for high-quality climate-smart irrigation technology, had received investments totalling more than USh 5.5 billion. This scheme will include developing a training programme for irrigation technology technicians to provide operations and maintenance services.

Tunisian contech startup, SeekMake, gets $539K from Lafayette Group to fuel international expansion SeekMake, a Tunisian construction technology startup, has raised $539,000 from Lafayette Group to support its international expansion plans. This investment is notable not only for its monetary value, but also because it is Lafayette Group's first investment in a Tunisian or foreign startup. Founded in 2018 by Adel Ayari and Zino Adidi, SeekMake is a digital platform that matches clients with construction and manufacturing companies across 40 countries. It allows for rapid concept generation and subsequent delivery of finished products. The startup says it provides several long-lasting, strong, and affordable materials. Aside from expanding into new markets, it has also experienced internal growth. Its team grew from four to thirty employees in just eight months. The startup is a go-between for manufacturers and consumers, streamlining the manufacturing process, cutting costs, and accelerating part production by days. It offers several manufacturing options, including Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining, sheet metal fabrication, 3D printing, laser cutting, and engraving. SeekMake has reached several milestones, including establishing partnerships with 72 manufacturers, expanding into 40 countries, and amassing a user and manufacturer base of over 10,000. SeekMake already boasts a diverse client base in Tunisia, the United States, and Australia. The company plans to use the new funds to expand into new markets, primarily in France and Germany, because they present valuable opportunities for collaboration with major clients and partners. Besides, it has established a subsidiary in Estonia as part of its expansion strategy.
How Patricia plans to pay customers back Key takeaways: After its token launch received some backlash, Patricia released a whitepaper detailing the intent behind the launch of Patricia tokens (PTK). It explained that the token is a debt instrument that will be issued to customers who lost bitcoin (BTC) and naira during the breach. While many questions about the token were answered, the exchange hasn't explained why it needs to be profitable before customers get funds or when, specifically, customers get their money. After announcing that it had been a victim of a breach, Nigerian crypto exchange, Patricia, halted withdrawals and deposits on its platform in April 2023. By August 18, 2023, it announced the launch of Patricia tokens (PTK), which all outstanding balances in naira and Bitcoin (BTC) will be converted to. It added that the newly launched token is a stablecoin equal to the US dollar in value — 1 PTK = $1. However, customers who have not been able to access their funds for months were not too pleased with the announcements. Questions such as how the token was backed and why Patricia converted the tokens without customer consent were raised. To answer these questions, the exchange published a whitepaper for PTK tokens detailing how it would help it recover from the breach and how customers who have lost BTC and naira to the hack would use it to claim their funds. Questions answered by Patricia token (PTK) white paper The whitepaper released by Patricia addressed some of the questions customers have concerning the token launch. Here are some of the answered questions. How will the Patricia token (PTK) work? The Patricia token will work like an IOU (I owe you) document, a way for Patricia to acknowledge how much it owes you. Per the whitepaper, "It symbolizes a promise by Patricia Technologies to pay holders 1 USDT for each Patricia Token in the future." It will serve as a "debt instrument" or debt token in exchange for the assets lost during the breach. What will customers do with the token? Customers whose BTC and naira balances have been converted to the PTK can redeem it for USDT, which can then be converted to other cryptocurrencies like BTC or fiat like naira. However, all conversion rates will be based on the US dollar value of the asset as of April 29, 2023. When will customers get the PTK tokens? The PTK tokens will be available to customers who lost BTC and naira to the breach when the new Patricia app — Patricia Plus App — launches. Who has launched debt tokens like PTK before? Bitfinex launched BFX in 2016 when it lost 119,756 bitcoins ($72 million at the time) to a hack. Like Patricia, Bitfinex issued a debt token called BFX to customers who lost money to the hack and bought it back from them over a period of time. Unanswered questions by Patricia One major question in the minds of customers is when they will be able to access their funds. While the PTK whitepaper did not give a specific answer to this question, some information within and outside the paper might provide pointers. When will customers be able to redeem their PTK tokens for USDT? Patricia has not given a specific time as to when customers will be able to convert their PTK tokens for USDT. How long will it take for all customers to get their money back? When Bitfinex issued the BFX debt token, it took eight months for it to buy back $72 million worth of tokens from customers. Given that Patricia allegedly lost $2 million to the breach, the fund recovery process for customers could be shorter. How will Patricia fund the token? According to internal communications, Patricia is currently raising funds and has been largely successful at it. The exchange is confident customers will be able to redeem all PTK tokens for USDT. How will Patricia release funds to customers? Patricia will automate the release of funds with a smart contract. The contract will release funds based on the company's profitability. According to the whitepaper, it "will automate Patricia Token release in line with exchange profitability." This means the company has to consistently make money to release funds to customers. Interestingly, a source close to the company shared that other parts of the company, such as its over-the-counter (OTC) business, have remained profitable during the withdrawal freeze on its retail business. While Patricia might have clarified the reasons why it launched PTK, it still has a lot of work to do to earn the trust of retail customers.
Nigeria to create National AI Strategy Google Flights is rolling out a new feature that will assist users in deciding whether it is preferable to book their flight right away or wait for a price reduction. In addition to indicating whether prices are low, average, or high, Google Flights will now explicitly state when it is the cheapest time to book a flight. The current tool compares historical averages for the same route and provides a "Price history" graph in addition to its other functions. But you can now go one step further and learn "when prices have typically been lowest to book your chosen dates and destination." Here's what I've got for you today: How Patricia plans to repay customers Nigeria to create National AI Strategy How Patricia plans to repay customers In April 2023, the Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange Patricia shut down withdrawals and deposits on its platform after disclosing that it had experienced a breach. On August 18, 2023, it announced the launch of Patricia tokens (PTK), which all outstanding balances in naira and Bitcoin (BTC) will be converted to. However, customers, who have not accessed their money in months, were not pleased with the announcement. They raised questions, including how the token was backed and why Patricia converted them without customer consent. In his most recent story, Bolu provided some of these answers. For instance, if you are wondering how the PTK will work, Patricia explained that it will function much like an IOU (I owe you) document, which will allow the exchange to acknowledge how much it owes you. It will serve as a "debt instrument" or debt token in exchange for the assets lost during the breach. For more information, read Bolu’s story here: How Patricia plans to pay customers back Nigeria to create National AI Strategy Nigeria is seeking the world's best scientists with Nigerian ancestry to help create its National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy. This move will influence how the government develops innovative tech solutions to its most pressing national problems. Bosun Tijani, Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, said the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has already started developing a National Al Strategy. Consequently, the government is expanding its co-creation approach by curating a list to involve and include top Al researchers of Nigerian descent globally. Why does it matter? The government acknowledged that AI has evolved into a multifaceted technology that is revolutionising production and service provision and has the potential to impact social advancement and economic growth significantly. One study shows that by 2030, Al could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy. $3 trillion would come from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from new goods and services. Sidebar: Two weeks ago, Kashifu Inuwa, the Director-General of NITDA, announced plans to build AI developers’ communities across Nigeria to shape the future of technology in the country. He stated that they would begin in three states in 2023 and then strategise on expanding it to other states and, eventually, local government areas.

Visa partners banks and fintechs in Kenya to launch contactless payments Following the country's general elections on Saturday, the government of Gabon declared it would impose a nighttime curfew and shut down Internet access. Communications Minister, Rodrigue Mboumba Bissawou, announced the overnight curfew would begin on Sunday to "counter the spread of calls for violence... and false information." On Saturday morning, voters went to the polls for presidential, legislative, and local elections in which President Ali Bongo Ondimba, a descendant of a family that has ruled the Central African nation for more than 50 years, was running for re-election. Here's what I've got for you today: Visa partners banks and fintechs in Kenya to launch contactless payments Nigeria gets $500m loan Visa partners banks and fintechs in Kenya to launch contactless payments Visa is working with local banks and fintech companies in Kenya to launch contactless payments. Customers will be able to transact without a physical wallet or a card. Customers can use the Thales-powered service by tapping their Near-field communication (NFC) enabled smartphones at any contactless payment terminal to make in-store purchases using their banking app. Why is it important? Contactless payments are more secure than magnetic-stripe cards, which are easily skimmed by fraudsters, in addition to their convenience. According to Investopedia, a contactless transaction's data entry is encrypted, making it difficult to steal or intercept. Due to the documentation of every transaction, the customer and the company can more easily keep track of their money. The advantage of having less cash on-site for vendors is lower security risks. Have we seen this before? In June 2023, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Visa, and Thales collaborated to launch a contactless payment service. In May 2017, Safaricom launched the M-PESA 1Tap, a contactless payments service, in Nakuru County. Four months later, over 90,000 customers and 2,000 merchants signed up, and the telco extended the service to five additional counties: Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, and Nyeri. However, the contactless payments service died a natural death. Nigeria gets $500m loan Nigeria has received a loan of $500 million to support entrepreneurship and innovation in the digital industry. Bosun Tijani, Minister for Communications and the Digital Economy, announced this at a dinner hosted by the Ministry of Communications and the World Bank in his honour. According to him, the government will work with the Bank of Industry (BoI) to domicile the funding locally to support the growth and development of domestic companies and, ultimately, the nation's economy. Tijani stated his desire to work with institutions that will ensure Nigerian businesses benefit from the funds. The government wants to use the fund to attract more investment and increase the resources available to local business owners. It plans to add more investors to increase the funding available to assist Nigerian innovators. Local funding will become more readily available in the coming months, and as it does, the government plans to leverage that money. What’s more, Shubham Chaudhuri, the World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, stated that the international financial institution is collaborating with the federal government to guarantee the effective implementation and registration of digital national IDs for all Nigerians. He asserted that at least 148 million people of working age should have access to a digital national ID by the middle of next year, marking a significant advancement in inclusion and accessibility.

Airtel Uganda to pay Jamaican singer $180K How are you and how was your week? Some of my friends and I haven't had a great week. My experience isn't unique, though, because Africa has many challenges. But I wish you a pleasant weekend. Check on your friends this weekend, please. Enjoy yourself with them. Make memories, take goofy pictures, play games indoors, order or cook food, or do these things outside. Be there for them. Is this it? Is there anything I am missing? Of course, the podcast: The editorial team discussed Patricia's PTK launch, Moniepoint acquiring Kopo Kopo, and Flutterwave's IPO plans. Watch or listen here. Here's what I've got for you today: TikTok to open office in Kenya MoMo customers can send and receive money across Africa LemFI gets $33m Series A to scale Airtel Uganda to pay Jamaican singer $180K TikTok to open office in Kenya Following a petition to ban TikTok in Kenya, the short-form video platform has committed to working with the Kenyan government to set up a regional office in Nairobi. Yesterday, Kenya’s President, William Ruto, met with TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, and they agreed to collaborate to moderate content on its platform to adhere to Kenya's community standards. State House representatives also said that TikTok would hire more Kenyans to work for the platform, citing Kenya as one of the most active countries on the short-form video app. According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2023, Kenya has the highest TikTok usage rate worldwide, with 54% of users in the country using the app for general purposes and 29% for news. Kenya has the most TikTok users worldwide, so it makes sense to establish a regional office there, but will it? Recall how, in January 2022, the Nigerian government lifted a seven-month ban on Twitter (Now X), saying that the social media platform would establish a legal presence there in Q1 2022. However, Twitter did not announce plans to set up an office in Nigeria. In April 2021, when Jack Dorsey was still in charge of the microblogging website, Twitter opened its first African office in Ghana. However, when Elon Musk took over, he laid off nearly all the employees in Ghana in November 2022. I believe only time will tell if TikTok will open a regional office in Kenya. What do you think? MoMo customers can send and receive money across Africa MoMo customers can now send and receive money and settle their bills across Africa. It comes after Saana Capital, an international cross-border company with a licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), partnered with MoMo to enable seamless inbound and outbound transfers throughout Africa. Outbound refers to money leaving your account, whereas inbound refers to money coming in. I'll explain: Imagine you are a pineapple juice vendor. When someone buys a bottle, you receive money, which is inbound. However, you must purchase several things, including pineapples, bottles, and possibly water to make the juice. So, the money you spend to buy these items is an outbound payment transfer because it comes from your pocket. Essentially, it’s all about receiving and sending money. Previously, the inbound service was only available to customers in Uganda and Rwanda. However, the partnership will give other Africans access to this service. As of August 2022, MTN MoMo had over 51 million subscribers in about 15 markets, including Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Zambia, Benin, Cameroon, South Africa, and Madagascar. Sidebar: This news comes a few days after MTN announced that Mastercard had agreed to buy a minority stake in MoMo, MTN's $5.2 billion fintech division. LemFI gets $33m Series A to scale LemFi has raised a $33 million Series A to scale its growth, expand its product offering to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and innovate new product offerings based on users' needs. Left Lane Capital led the round, while Y Combinator, Zrosk, Global Founders Capital, and Olive Tree participated. Ridwan Olalere and Rian Cochran founded LemFi (previously Lemonade Finance), a platform that enables users to send, receive, and hold currencies of their country of origin and residence in 2020. The company ensures that users in the diaspora send money to more than ten nations, including Ghana, Kenya, Togo, Uganda, and Nigeria. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) granted Lemfi an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licence in 2021. This move allows it to offer customers more services, including higher transaction limits and e-money accounts. It came after LemFi acquired UK-based Rightcard Payment Services. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently granted Rightcard an International Money Transfer Operator (IMTO) licence, allowing LemFi to provide its services in partnership with Nigerian banks. LemFi collaborates with other companies to offer its services on the continent. For example, in Kenya, it works with Cellulant. However, the business wants to pursue more licences to spur expansion and development of new products. Airtel Uganda to pay Jamaican singer $180K In 2015, a Jamaican singer, Garfield Spence, also known as Konshens, sued Airtel Uganda for distributing his songs, including Gyal a bubble, So Mitan, and Simple Song, without his permission. He also said they refused to give him any royalties. What’s new? The High Court in Kampala has mandated that Airtel Uganda pay him $180,000 (or roughly USh 670 million) in general damages for copyright infringement. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants had illegally obtained his songs and sold them to Airtel subscribers for USh 600 each as caller tunes for the "Hello Tunes" programme. Thus, the court found the defendants guilty of copyright infringement and unjust enrichment. Along with USh 20 million ($5,300) in exemplary damages for copyright infringement, the court also granted general damages at an interest rate of 15% per year from the date of filing the lawsuit until payment in full.

Tech Operators Mixer 2023: Spotlighting the unsung heroes of the African tech space The Tech Operators Mixr event held on the 10th of August, 2023 was an event held in partnership between with Black Ops and Founders Factory Africa. The Operators Mixr was organised by XConnect. The networking-themed event brought together some of the faces behind the smooth running and operations of businesses in the tech startup scene, therefore putting a spotlight on the pivotal yet often underappreciated players in the tech space. The Tech Operators Mixer drew an impressive turnout of close to 200 attendees. The primary objective was to spotlight the essential roles played by tech operators, acknowledging their dedication and contributions that often remain in the background. It was a gathering that created an atmosphere for people to network, exchange ideas, build meaningful connections, and explore opportunities to collaborate. The event had seasoned operators and founders such as Gerald Black, Head of GTM, Anchor; Babajide Duroshola, General Manager, M-KOPA; Seni Sulyman, CEO, Talstack, and founder, BlackOps; Amara Muoneke, Ololade Odunsi, Talent Acquisition Lead, Founders Factory Africa, Venture Design Advisor, Founders Factory Africa; and Oluseye Soyode-Johnson, founder, NuConti, among others. There was a continuous emphasis on the importance of supporting operators in the tech startup ecosystem. Some of the reasons given are: Operators are people who bring practical knowledge and expertise to building and scaling startups. Their insights enhance execution, accelerate growth, and increase scalability. They offer a valuable network, reduce risk, provide mentorship, boost investor confidence, attract talent, aid in adapting to change, and help translate long-term visions into actionable steps. Their involvement bridges the gap between startup ideas and successful execution, contributing to a thriving entrepreneurial landscape. About the organisers XConnect fosters a thriving tech startup ecosystem by facilitating strategic connections and offering a range of specialised services. Black Ops is an invitation-only community built exclusively for African operators to support their collective journey of building and scaling great companies. Founders Factory Africa Provides capital and tailored hands-on support to help founders overcome their challenges.
LemFi raises $33 million Series A to ease remittance for immigrants An estimated 160 million people born in Africa now live outside the continent. For some, education was the vehicle that took them away, but for others, it was work. Yet, most have one thing in common – the need to send money back home to friends or relatives. Despite contributing $95 billion to the African economy in 2022, the process of sending money is fraught with difficulties. Financial institutions like Western Union and MoneyGram are some of the most popular options, but there’s still room for more entrants. In 2020, Ridwan Olalere and Rian Cochran, both former employees at Chinese-owned fintech OPay, launched LemFi to ease the process of sending and receiving money for immigrants. According to Olalere, who previously worked at Flutterwave and Uber, after the pair left OPay, they wanted to solve problems they encountered while working for the fintech. While cross-border payment within the continent was a problem they identified, facilitating payments from the West was an equally attractive challenge to solve. LemFi offers a multi-currency account for immigrants to hold, send, and receive money in both the currencies of their home country and that of their host country. Users can also send money to more than 30 countries. Today, the startup is announcing a $33 million Series A round led by Left Lane Capital. Global Founders Capital, Zrosk, Y Combinator, and Olive Tree are the other investors in the round. Since it launched in 2020, the startup has picked up an IMTO licence in Nigeria and completed the acquisition of Rightcard Payment Services in the UK. The acquisition now allows LemFi to enable higher transaction amounts and offer better fund security for users. The IMTO licence, on the other hand, ensures it can process remittances directly to Nigerian bank accounts without an intermediary. In June, it also launched in Kenya, and changed its name from Lemonade Finance to LemFi. Explaining the reason for the rebrand, Cochran explained that when the startup launched, the founders always knew that, given the popularity of the name lemonade, there was a possibility that they would run into trademark or copyright issues with older brands. Cross-border payments startups are exploring the right way to power the future of work Despite raising a large round amid a global venture capital slowdown, Olalere and Cochran admit that it was a difficult and painful process that took the better part of a year. “VCs are just much more specific about the investments they want to make. They make much more informed decisions; they have all the time in the world to decide, whereas once it was, ‘Hey, we’re closing in two weeks. Are you in or out?’ On top of all of that, we’re a financial services company, and so you want to be sure that whoever is going to lead can do an in-depth diligence. That can take a long time,” Cochran said. As part of the transaction, Matthew Miller, Principal at Left Lane Capital, will join LemFi’s Board of Directors. “LemFi has been very deliberate and strategic in acquiring licenses and building a robust network of financial institution partners to facilitate cross-border payments for immigrants. We’re excited to support LemFi as it expands its product offering to serve more immigrant communities globally,” he said. How Africans are treated by global financial institutions is well documented. PayPal, for example, allows account opening for Africans, but not withdrawals, and Olalere explains that it has influenced how they’ve built LemFi. Identifying how they could onboard Africans who are often locked out of global financial systems while ensuring that they protect their partners from potential risks has been one of their major issues. Having seen their operations grow to accommodate more countries, Cochran added that navigating the different regulatory requirements has been a vital learning process for the team. While declining to comment on the extent of their growth or the specific terms of the acquisition, the co-founders explained that the size of the round is an indication of the growth they’ve experienced. The funds will now be used to drive product development, expansions, and potential acquisitions.
MTN’s fintech and Saana Capital partner to allow MoMo users to send and receive money across Africa MoMo Payment Service Bank (PSB) and Saana Capital, an international cross-border company with a licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), have partnered to enable bill payment services and seamless inbound and outbound transfers throughout Africa. Inbound and outbound services enable you to receive and send money. Inbound payment transfers, such as those from online sales, invoices, or subscriptions, involve receiving funds from customers. Transferring funds to partners, suppliers, employees, or other parties for several things, such as bills, salaries, or taxes, is an outbound payment transfer. Previously, the inbound service was only available to customers who wanted to send money from Uganda and Rwanda. However, the partnership will give Africans access to this service, which includes payment services. In about 15 markets, including Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Zambia, Benin, Cameroon, South Africa, and Madagascar, MTN MoMo had over 51 million MoMo subscribers as of August 2022. Per a statement, MoMo customers in Nigeria will be notified via SMS whenever anyone sends money to their wallets from the countries mentioned. It will also add the local currency equivalent to their MoMo wallet at the transfer time. Because of this collaboration, MoMo PSB customers will not need foreign currency or domiciliary accounts to send and receive money directly from different African nations using their MoMo accounts. CEO of MoMo PSB, Eli Hini, said, “This collaboration resonates with our commitment to deliver innovative financial solutions that cater to the evolving needs of our customers. With this service, we are making cross-border transfers and bill payments across Africa more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective than ever before.” This news comes a few days after MTN announced that Mastercard had agreed to buy a minority stake in its $5.2 billion fintech division.
TikTok to open an office in Kenya and work with the government to moderate content on its platform After a meeting with TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, on Thursday, Kenyan President William Ruto announced that offensive or inappropriate content would be removed from the short-form video platform. TikTok will collaborate with the Kenyan government to moderate content on its platform to adhere to community standards. State House officials also said that TikTok would open a regional office in Nairobi and hire more Kenyans to work for the platform, citing Kenya as one of the most active countries on the short-form video app. According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2023, Kenya has the highest TikTok usage rate worldwide, with 54% of users in the country using the app for general purposes and 29% for news. This move follows a petitioner’s plea to lawmakers to ban TikTok in Kenya. The Majority Leader, Kimani Ichung'wa, said that because the app has primarily employed young people, parliament cannot oversee its suspension. Opiyo Wandayi, the Minority Leader, agreed, stating that given Kenya's high unemployment rate and the difficult times the country is experiencing, the nation cannot survive independently in the digital age. Consequently, President Ruto stated that YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook have agreed to push for revenue from youth-created content. He noted that the government has engaged the leadership of these companies to create opportunities for talented Kenyans. What’s more, on August 2, 2023, the Ministry of Information, Communication, and the Digital Economy of Kenya announced it would review the laws protecting social media users. He also expressed concern about the current trend of TikTok users going live between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. and sharing explicit content.
South Africa wants to stop harmful content online YouTube is testing a feature that allows users to search for a song by humming, singing, or recording it on Android devices. Users with access to the experiment can switch between the new song search feature and YouTube voice search while humming, singing, or recording a song for three or more seconds. The platform then recognises the song and points the user to relevant YouTube videos that contain the song they were looking for, which could be official music videos, user-generated content, or Shorts. Here's what I've got for you today: NALA launches payments from UK and EU to Nigeria Cellulant to lay off 20% of its workforce South Africa wants to stop harmful content online NALA launches payments from UK and EU to Nigeria Nigerians in the United Kingdom and the European Union can now send money home using Tanzanian cross-border platform, NALA. Customers can download the app from the App or Play Store to transfer money from their cards, bank account, or Google or Apple Pay to a Nigerian bank account. While NALA currently only allows customers to send money into Nigeria, the company is working on obtaining the necessary licence to enable customers to also send money out of Nigeria. The platform is also available in Tanzania, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. NALA intends to invest in Nigeria by expanding the number of local jobs it offers and forming alliances with domestic players like banks and payout providers. In March 2023, NALA announced that the Bank of Tanzania had granted it a licence to offer payment systems, opening the door for direct integration with banks and mobile money providers like M-PESA. It also committed to investing $1 million to build projects in Tanzania.NALA also planned to invest $5 million (KSh 636 million) into its Kenyan operations. Cellulant to lay off 20% of its workforce Cellulant will let go of 20% of its staff in the "coming days" as part of a workforce restructuring. This is the payments company’s second round of layoffs, following a headcount reduction in early 2023. The company, which operates in 19 nations, wants to focus on a product-led strategy that creates user-centric products for growth. Why? Cellulant says the new strategy is influenced by changing market dynamics and investments in automation. Its recent reorganisation of its product portfolio into four distinct categories also played a part. The payments company is combining some roles while also developing new ones. It says it will offer impacted workers exit packages and extended medical coverage for themselves and their families. South Africa wants to stop harmful content online South Africans have until September 8, 2023, to comment on the new draft rules published by the Film and Publication Board (FPB) to stop online harm. These guidelines, published in three parts, cover classifying harmful content, preventing online harm, and peer-to-peer video sharing. What is harmful content? Per the regulator, it includes child pornography, hate speech, and content that amounts to war propaganda, advocates hatred based on a distinguishable group characteristic, and constitutes incitement to cause harm. Prohibited content includes explicit sexual conduct, rape, bestiality, incest, conduct or an act degrading to human beings, and the explicit infliction of domestic violence. When is a content harmful? When a person experiences emotional, psychological, or moral distress due to a piece of content, whether a movie, game, or publication distributed via any online or offline medium, including the internet, that content is harmful. The FPB asserted that, in determining whether content is harmful, one must consider the legal framework that oversees freedom of expression and speech and any limitations. Additionally, the regulator extends peer-to-peer networks to include messaging platforms and private groups on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram, and it forbids the dissemination of intimate content without the subject's or subjects' consent or to harm them.

NALA launches payments from the UK and EU to Nigeria, plans to allow Nigerians to send money abroad NALA, a Tanzanian fintech startup, has begun accepting payments from the United Kingdom and the European Union to Nigeria. Customers can use the app to transfer money from their cards, bank accounts, or Google or Apple Pay to a Nigerian bank account. Users can download the app from the App Store or Play Store, sign up, and verify their identity before using the platform. When sending money to Nigeria, enter the recipient's bank information, select a payment option, and approve the transfer. “Currently, NALA allows customers to send money into Nigeria. We are working on the licencing to allow customers to also send money out of Nigeria,” NALA's Founder and CEO, Benjamin Fernandes, says. The Tanzanian company states it consistently strives to offer the most competitive prices compared to other service providers. Customers can also compare prices from several providers within the app, ensuring they get the best deal. How NALA is easing access to financial services for Tanzanians Given that 1 out of every 4 Africans is from Nigeria, per Fernandes, the market is a clear frontier for NALA's expansion across Africa. “Nigeria is the largest economic market in Africa. As of 2021, Nigeria’s GDP totalled $441 billion, placing it ahead of economies like Egypt and South Africa. Nigeria also has a robust migrant population, with almost 400k diasporans living in the United States and 200k living in the United Kingdom.” Customers can send money via the app to 4 other West African nations: Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Cameroon. It is also available in East African countries, including Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. Meanwhile, in March 2023, NALA announced that the Bank of Tanzania had granted it a licence to offer payment systems, opening the door for direct integration with banks and mobile money providers like M-PESA. It also committed to investing $1 million to build projects in Tanzania. NALA also planned to invest $5 million (KSh 636 million) into its Kenyan operations. "We intend to invest in Nigeria by increasing the number of local jobs we provide and creating partnerships with local players such as banks and payout providers," Fernandes says of the company's plans for the Nigerian market.
Hustlers aren't paying back in Kenya Vodafone Cash customers with smart metres in Ghana can now purchase prepaid electricity by dialling *110#. Customers can register up to two metres, choose their preferred metre, enter the transaction amount, and verify it with a PIN. Currently only accessible via USSD, Vodafone Ghana plans to add the payment feature to its MyVodafoneApp (MVA) soon. Here's what I've got for you today: Moniepoint acquires a Kenyan fintech Kenya's Hustler Fund has a high loan default rate Moniepoint acquires a Kenyan fintech Nigerian fintech, Moniepoint, has entered Kenya by acquiring Kopo Kopo, a Kenyan fintech company. This move follows approval from the Competition Authority of Kenya after the companies met the required financial threshold. Why the regulator’s approval? The CAK's consent must be gotten before proceeding with any merger-related transactions involving parties whose combined revenue or assets exceed KSh 1 billion. Moniepoint provides loans, business management tools, business payment channels, and banking services like savings and investments. Kopo Kopo offers the same but a banking service. Over 1.5 million businesses use Moniepoint in Nigeria, and it wants to replicate that in Kenya. Sidebar: Moniepoint recently entered the personal banking market in Nigeria by launching a consumer app and debit cards. The company, which previously offered businesses an all-in-one platform for payments, banking, and operations, will make its services available to everyone. The fintech currently has the largest agency banking network in the country. Kenya's Hustler Fund has a high loan default rate Kenyan-backed financial inclusion fund, Hustler Fund, has higher loan default rates than commercial banks, Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOS), and other financial institutions. What's the Hustler Fund? Here's some background information: When William Ruto, Kenyan President, ran for office in 2022, he pledged to establish the Hustler Fund to establish a new economic order. On November 30, 2022, the President launched the fund to lend Kenyans, particularly low-income earners or hustlers, at least $420 million. It offers short-term loans — between KSh 500 and KSh 50,000 — to Kenyan businesses at an 8% interest rate. Now, 29% of the KSh 10.2 billion ($70.6m) in outstanding loans are considered “portfolio-at-risk”, meaning that the borrowers have not paid as agreed upon. In other words, the Hustler Fund's loans, totalling KSh 2.9 billion ($20m) in borrowed funds, are categorised as non-performing loans (NPL). This 29 per cent is significant compared to commercial banks, SACCOS, and microfinance institutions. As of December 2022, SACCOS’ portfolio-at-risk or non-performing loan (NPL) percentage was 8.6%. NPL rates in Kenya for commercial banks are 14.5%, while NPL rates for microfinance banks are 23%. What’s more, the Kenyan government has implemented credit scoring to reduce the number of people who default on Hustler Fund loans.

Moniepoint makes Kenyan foray with the acquisition of Kopo Kopo Just days after announcing the launch of its personal banking app, Moniepoint Inc. has disclosed that it has received approval from the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) to complete the acquisition of Kopo Kopo. A statement by the CAK states that the approval was granted after checks revealed that it would not negatively impact competition in the digital credit space or raise public interest concerns. "We have a publicly stated interest in Kenya as part of our mission to provide financial happiness for people across Africa. We are delighted to have taken the first step by securing regulatory approval for our plans to provide financial happiness to Kenyans and look forward to progressing the transaction," Tosin Eniolorunda, Group CEO, Moniepoint Inc., said. In Kenya, Kopo Kopo offers payment and credit services for businesses and was founded in 2011 by Ben Lyon and Dylan Higgins. Initially launched in the United States, the Kopo Kopo team moved to Kenya after seeing how competitive the American payments market was. In Kenya, they collaborated with Safaricom to open up Lipa Na M-Pesa to SMEs, splitting the transaction fees between them. By 2012, they were issuing working capital loans backed by Afb. Since then, they've received investments from the Khosla Impact Fund, Accion Venture Lab, and Bamboo Finance. After leading Payday's seed round, there were reports suggesting Moniepoint was in talks to acquire Payday. However, the company quickly moved to quash these rumours, insisting that its investment was strategic. But by June, it announced the appointment of Ross Strike as Head of M&A and Investor Relations, signifying its intention to pursue mergers in its next phase. With the acquisition of Kopo Kopo, Moniepoint will make its first real expansion two years after it first disclosed plans to expand across West and North Africa.
Ride-hailing drivers in Nigeria get a new name WhatsApp is testing more advanced text formatting, such as syntax-based formatting for quotes and bullet lists. Users must format text using a series of operators, including “ “, *," and /, that surround the text to be formatted. The advanced text formatting is not uncommon. Apps like Slack and Google Chat offer syntax in addition to a formatting bar. WhatsApp also supports syntax for basic formatting such as bold, italics, and strikethrough. Here's what I've got for you today: Somalia bans TikTok, Telegram Zanifu's $11.2m pre-Series A Ride-hailing drivers in Nigeria get a new name Somalia bans TikTok, Telegram Internet Service Providers in Somalia have until August 24, 2023, to block access to social media platforms — TikTok and Telegram — and an online betting site, 1Xbet, or face legal repercussions. The Minister of Communications and Technology, Jama Hassan Khalif, said al-Shabaab and other organisations use these apps to disseminate violence, propaganda, and false information. Al-Shabaab, for example, frequently posts videos on TikTok and messages on Telegram to demonstrate their attacks, recruit new members, or threaten their enemies. For context, al-Shabaab means “the youth” in Arabic. It first appeared as the radical youth wing of the now-defunct Union of Islamic Courts in Somalia, which ruled Mogadishu, the nation’s capital, in 2006 before Ethiopian forces drove them out. Here’s another reason: The government says they expose children to depraved material, including pornography, gambling, and drugs. They also cause people to lose sight of their religious and cultural values. How are people reacting to this news? While some support it and argue that the ban will protect the nation's security and morality, others contend that it violates their right to free speech and access to information. They add that al-Shabaab and other groups can still communicate using other platforms and methods. Do you agree? Is a ban on these apps the way forward? Sidebar: Briget Connect Consultancy CEO, Bob Ndolo, submitted a petition to National Assembly Speaker, Moses Wetang'ula, to ban TikTok in Kenya. Zanifu's $11.2m pre-Series A Kenyan fintech startup, Zanifu, has raised $11.2 million in debt-equity funding in a pre-Series A to expand its solutions to distributors and scale its operations in Kenya. Founded by Steve Biko (CEO) and Sebastian Mithika in 2017, Zanifu provides inventory financing to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). It targets businesses that struggle to secure credit from formal lenders due to a lack of structure, accounting records, and assets suitable for use as collateral. Depending on the company size, distributors may receive up to $10,000 in stock financing, and retailers receive goods worth $200 to $500. Due to Zanifu's expansion, 500 distributors have joined its clientele, and 13,000 microbusinesses have received credit from the company. Monthly interest rates range from 5% to 6%, and a 99.2% repayment rate has been reported thus far due to several factors, including Zanifu's underwriting algorithm. The company also plans to use the funds to provide additional financial services, such as insurance, and develop tools to, for example, assist businesses with inventory management and bookkeeping. Ride-hailing drivers in Nigeria has a new name In Nigeria, drivers for ride-hailing apps like Bolt, Uber, and InDrive have united under a new union, the Amalgamated Union of App-based Transporters of Nigeria (AUATON). Formerly known as the Amalgamated Union of App-based Transport Workers of Nigeria (AUATWON), the union had a narrower focus and included all transporters. Following the Nigerian Ministry of Labour's approval of AUATON, the General Secretary of AUATON, Ibrahim Ayoade, said the union will now cover all gig workers engaged in the transportation industry, not just drivers. Just as they did when they were previously under AUATWON aegis, ride-hailing drivers can successfully organise, protest, and demand their rights. What’s more, Ayoade said the process to become a trade union by the government began in 2016.

Somali government bans TikTok, Telegram to combat misinformation The government of Somalia has announced that it'll ban social media platforms — TikTok and Telegram — and an online betting site, 1Xbet, to combat and stop indecent activities, content, and propaganda for extremism. In a statement, Jama Hassan Khalif, the Minister of Communications and Technology, gave Internet Service Providers until August 24, 2023, to implement the ban or face legal action. Khalif demanded telcos in Somalia block access to the platforms because terrorists and immoral organisations use them to spread horrifying images and misinformation to the public. He also said that the use of social media by terrorist organisations poses a constant threat to the safety and stability of society. Consequently, the ministry is working to safeguard Somalis' moral behaviour when using communication and Internet tools, which have impacted their way of life and increased "bad practices." The move comes months after Somali President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, declared another military offensive against al-Shabaab to eliminate it within the next five months. Al-Shabaab means "the youth" in Arabic. It first appeared as the radical youth wing of the now-defunct Union of Islamic Courts in Somalia, which ruled Mogadishu in 2006 before Ethiopian forces drove them out. In August 2022, the Somali government launched an offensive against al-Shabaab, seizing the opportunity to capitalise on growing unrest regarding the Islamist insurgency, particularly among the politically powerful Hawiye clan. Al-Shabaab insurgents frequently post about their activities on TikTok and Telegram. They post videos, press releases, and audio of interviews with their commanders on Telegram's messaging platform. In 2022, the Somali government ordered Internet Service Providers to block al-Shabab websites, but some platforms remain accessible globally. 1XBet, on the other hand, has sparked concerns about the likelihood of gambling addiction in young people. What’s more, last week, Briget Connect Consultancy CEO, Bob Ndolo, submitted a petition to National Assembly Speaker, Moses Wetang'ula, asking to ban TikTok in Kenya.
How this startup made ₦100m selling small chops online, with just 9 employees One day in 2015, Uche Ukonu's final year at Covenant University, he had a strong craving for small chops. He wanted it for himself, but most people who sold small chops around him only took large orders, which would be fulfilled if the order was placed a day in advance. Wondering why it was so difficult to get small chops, he started asking people if they had trouble satisfying their cravings too. He found out that if there isn't an owambe or small gathering, getting small chops for yourself was almost impossible. And like that, the idea for Smallchopsng began to form in his mind. Today, that idea has generated ₦100 million in revenue over the past seven years. "What started as me craving small chops on demand, turned into me owning a small market share in Nigeria's Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry," Ukonu, Founder and CEO of Smallchopsng recalls. Nigeria's small chops culture I'm not one to assume, but I'm confident many Nigerians know what small chops are. If for some reason you don't know what small chops are, here's a definition. Small chops are bite-sized Nigerian snacks usually served at social events like weddings, graduations, or Techpoint Pitch Friday. Depending on the gathering or who the caterer is, a pack of small chops usually consists of puff puff, samosas, chicken, and spring rolls. On their own, some of these items are not Nigerian — spring rolls, for example, are from Asia — which makes me wonder if small chops are even a Nigerian snack. There's a dearth of resources on how the small chops culture in Nigeria began, but this article by Kitchen Butterfly might be on to something. It traces the origin of small chops to British colonialism in the 1950s. Back then it was anchovies on toast and devilled eggs, but over the years it began to evolve, influenced largely by Indians and Chinese professionals who came to the country for various reasons. Small chops are essentially a fusion of British, Indian, Chinese, and Nigerian cuisines that have become an essential part of what Ukonu describes as the Nigerian party culture. It is within this party culture that Smallchopsng's main competitive advantage lies. "If you want rice, for example, you could go to Glovo or Chowdeck. If the cost of the rice and the cost of delivering it is too high, chances are that you'll just go to the kitchen and boil the rice yourself. "But then if you're craving small chops or you have an event that requires small chops, it is unlikely that you'll pop into your kitchen and start rolling out [the] packages." Again, I'm not one to assume, but I'd say most Nigerians only get to eat small chops when there's a social event. I only get to eat it once a month at the Techpoint Pitch Friday event. We could say, therefore, that Smallchopsng is democratising access to small chops, modifying that part of the culture where we have to wait for gatherings before we eat small chops. However, offering small chops in small units, for as low as ₦700 per unit is where Ukonu's tech and business acumen shines. A bootstrapped process Smallchopsng launched officially in Lagos in 2016 and has been bootstrapped since. The capital required was Ukonu's brain and time, which has been and continues to be a critical component of the business' survival for the past seven years. When he does not have to wear his business hat, he takes on technical roles and writes code. During times when he has to be a businessman, he'll trade his other skills for the services of a developer. However, bootstrapping the company all these years required careful planning. His information and communications engineering degree definitely came in handy in engineering a process that requires a very lean team, so much so that there are only two people at the heart of the company's operations. "We had a target of how much it would take to stay alive at the very beginning and I had an estimate of how much it would cost to get that revenue in terms of marketing and advertising. "You could say that Facebook gave us our first funding, because back then, you didn't have to pay for ads upfront. So we committed $150. We took a bet that by the end of the month, we would reach our target to cover our bills and marketing spend." They met their target that month, and they've been doing that every year since. No small chops were made Ukonu's planning was meticulous. He was always in search of the most efficient way to operate without compromising on quality. This is why Smallchopsng does not make the small chops it delivers. Smallchopsng onboards local production partners also known as caterers, creating a caterer network across Lagos State. This means that there's a caterer within a certain radius of where an order originates. But before this mode of operations, Smallchopsng made its small chops in-house between 2018 band 2020. The goal was to understand the business of making good small chops, and thus, determine what their standard would be. Today, Ukonu is confident that the caterers who use Smallchopsng branding and packaging maintain the required quality. Those two years birthed the Rating Index, a way to identify caterers (or vendors) whose culinary skills are worthy of Smallchopsng. The Index rates them on many things, including hygiene, experience, education, and technical capability. "Everybody's producing the same thing, but they produce our menus and our packages. We own all of the IP rights on the packages that are sold on the platform, but we don't produce any of them. We handle technology, product and marketing, branding and operations, while vendors handle production. "Ukonu explained." The initial business model — a 20% commission on each package — was tweaked after two years of making small chops. "So instead of a commission, we negotiate production costs with our partners. We know how much it costs because we've produced it. And then we set the price based on our market research on user behaviour, value perception, and also affordability. "Our revenue is the difference between what people are willing to pay and the best price we can get for producing quality small chops. Now, that margin could be anywhere from 20% to 30% on certain products." Staying profitable Smallchopsng has carved out a 15% profit margin from its ₦100 million revenue. A great way to sum up the startup's path to profitability is through these three key pillars: Automation, Lean workforce, Impeccable customer experience. Ukonu is a stickler for automation, this is why the startup's core operations only require two people. Besides Ukonu's Co-founders, Farida Ahmed and Michael Chukwu, and interns, the entire workforce totals nine. We handle technology, product and marketing, branding and operations, while vendors handle production. "Ukonu explained." It runs all of our internal operations, routes orders, and informs the riders of where they need to pick up and deliver with very minimal human involvement. "As we grow, we scale up the ability of that software, so we've never had a core operations team of more than two people." Customer experience, however, is the only team in the company that is scaled up ever so often. This is because "we do not want to automate customer experience, everybody needs that human interaction." Smallchopsng has over 10,000 registered users. However, you can order on the platform without registering. On average, the platform completes 100,000 orders annually. On bad years, it sees 80,000 orders, while a 200,000 deliveries are done in a good year. A great way to sum up the startup's path to profitability is through these three key pillars: Automation, Lean workforce and Impeccable customer experience. However, in an economy like Nigeria's, it isn't always smooth sailing. "The core challenge we face is what I will unofficially call the Nigerian factor." It is that part of operations that cannot be automated, the side of the business where your lines of code end, and your best bet at controlling them is perhaps a prayer. The Nigerian factor ranges from economic instability to partners that aren't technologically savvy. Smallchopsng works with independent riders responsible for fuelling and maintaining their bikes. Expectedly, they hit a snag after the recent increase in the cost of fuel. "One of our logistics partners [a rider] delayed delivering a package by almost an hour because he was looking for fuel. There are very minimal ways you can mitigate against things like that." Funding and the future Smallchopsng is open to venture capital funding, but after being in operations for nearly a decade, Ukonu and his team will be very selective when it comes to choosing who to raise from. "The raise has to go beyond the cash to include strategic partnerships both for operations and scale to hit our ten-year goal." That goal is making small chops available to everyone within and outside Nigeria. Yes, Smallchopsng wants to go global but before that, it plans to take its first step outside Lagos next year and hopefully in the next three years, people in other parts of the world will get access to its services.
Kenyan fintech startup, Zanifu, wants to provide more financial services on the back of a $11.2 million pre-Series A Kenyan fintech startup, Zanifu, has secured $11.2 million in debt-equity funding in a pre-Series A round to expand its solutions to distributors and scale its operations in Kenya. The company plans to use the funds to provide additional financial services, such as insurance, and develop tools to, for example, assist businesses with inventory management and bookkeeping. Founded by Steve Biko (CEO) and Sebastian Mithika in 2017, Zanifu provides inventory financing to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). It targets businesses that encounter difficulties securing credit from formal lenders due to a lack of structure, accounting records, and assets suitable for use as collateral. Zanifu offers credit to businesses based on the data it collects from them and their suppliers. By paying their suppliers directly, the fintech lowers the risk of the line of credit. Depending on the company size, distributors may receive up to $10,000 in stock financing, and retailers receive goods worth $200 to $500. While 500 distributors have already received services due to the expansion of their clientele, 13,000 microbusinesses have received credit from it. The monthly interest rate ranges from 5% to 6%, and a 99.2% repayment rate has been reported thus far due to several factors, including Zanifu's underwriting algorithm. Customers can check their credit limit and place orders using an Android application. The startup has incorporated several payment options into the app for prompt repayments. Retailers can also use it to pay for inventory acquired from distributors outside their database.
Is Patricia's token launch an exit scam? Here are the circumstances surrounding the launch of PTK Nigerian crypto exchange, Patricia has announced the launch of a native token called Patricia token (PTK). The native token which it claims is a stablecoin pegged to the dollar ($1 = 1PTK), will replace customers' outstanding balances in bitcoin (BTC and naira). In the company's announcement post on X (formerly Twitter), it said the operations of the exchange will be moved to a new platform called Patricia Plus app. This is coming after the company announced that it was a victim of a breach that led to the loss of funds. While it said no customer funds were affected, users of the platform have been unable to access their funds since April. Patricia's announcement has been met with takes that suggest the company might be planning an exit scam, leaving customers whose money has been trapped on the platform stranded. The import of this tweet is skipping everyone commenting "when are we getting our money? "You're not getting it lol.They've taken your naira and bitcoin and replaced it in your hot wallet with a worthless shitcoin called "Patricia Token".Exit scam Pro max. Is Patricia's token launch an exit scam? This article will look at the circumstances surrounding the lunch. What are native tokens? Native tokens are digital assets that are native to a cryptocurrency exchange. Examples are Binance's BNB, Quidax's QDX, Bundle's BDX and FTX's FTT. Why is Patricia launching a native token? Crypto exchanges launch native tokens for many reasons, some include; To increase liquidity. To incentivise trading activity. Facilitate community ownership of the exchange. Fund-raising tactic Given Patricia's troubles with money recently, it can be inferred that the native token was launched as a fund-raising tactic. According to the Founder of Hyperspace Technologies, Oluseyi Akindeinde, launching native tokens is a way of raising funds for many exchanges. When these tokens are launched, the exchange holds a significant part of the tokens, meaning if the value of the token increases the company makes more money. The red flags in the token launch As pointed out in tweets, there are a couple of red flags in Patricia's launch of PTK. The token is not available on any cryptocurrency aggregator The token is not available on any of the top crypto aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Coingecko. These aggregators provide more information on the token such as its actual value, the number of tokens issued, the token's contract address, and the blockchain it was launched. Akindeinde, however, said it could take some time for newly launched tokens to be listed on aggregators. It is not available on any blockchain PTK is not available on popular blockchains where exchanges launch their native tokens. For example, you can find PayPal's recently launched stablecoin, PYUSD on Ethereum blockchain upon which it was launched. A source close to the matter said the token has not been launched yet and it will only serve as an instrument to hold debt within Patricia's books. Converting user balance without consent In its announcement on X, Patricia said outstanding balances will be converted to PTK. This was done without customer consent and many fear that they might not be able to exchange the token for fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. If customers can withdraw funds, a withdrawal surge will cause PTK to de-peg leaving customers who were unable to make withdrawals stranded. Techpoint Africa has reached out to Patricia for comments concerning the issues raised, but the exchange is yet to respond.
Twiga Foods reduces its headcount Have you ever been the target of (cyber)bullying? I don't recall being bullied in primary school, but I was insulted in junior secondary school. While it was mostly about my autism, I didn't think it was a big deal. But, bullying in secondary schools causes anxiety, low self-esteem, and even suicide. In South Africa, for example, it is a major contributor to teen suicide. Did you know that children aged 10 to 18 can go to prison for bullying in South Africa? The Children's Act 38 of 2005 allows children to bring bullying cases to court to receive support and protection so they don't commit suicide. It also seeks to rehabilitate bullies as opposed to punishing them. However, as a last resort, juveniles who bully others may go to jail. Here's what I've got for you today: Is Patricia's token launch an exit scam? Twiga Foods reduces its headcount The X glitch or Elon strikes again Is Patricia's token launch an exit scam? In May 2023, Patricia announced it was a victim of a security breach that compromised its Bitcoin and naira assets. What now? On Saturday, the cryptocurrency exchange announced the launch of Patricia token (PTK), a native token. For context, native tokens are digital assets that are native to a cryptocurrency exchange. Examples are Binance's BNB, Quidax's QDX, Bundle's BDX and FTX's FTT. The native token, which Patricia claims is a stablecoin pegged to the dollar ($1 = 1PTK), will replace customers' outstanding balances in bitcoin (BTC and naira). The crypto exchange stated that a new platform, the Patricia Plus app, would house the exchange's operations. However, several people have responded to Patricia's announcement by speculating that the business may be preparing an exit scam, leaving customers whose money has been trapped on the platform stranded. So, why is Patricia launching a native token if it is not an exit scam? If it is, what are the red flags? If I were to answer your questions, a newsletter would not be the best medium to do so because I’d be leaving out several details. But Bolu answered all the questions you might have. You can find it here: Is Patricia's token launch an exit scam? Here are the circumstances surrounding the launch of PTK Twiga Foods reduces its headcount Kenyan B2B eCommerce startup, Twiga Foods, has reduced its headcount by about 283 staff — one-third — of its 850 permanent employees due to challenging market conditions. The most recent layoffs will affect employees in all markets. They will receive compensation and severance packages in full compliance with applicable labour laws. Twiga's CEO, Peter Njonjo, said the business has been on a “transformative path” to become lean, agile, and economically efficient. Additionally, it has put into practice several interventions to adopt and maintain the business during these challenging economic times. Twiga will keep running Twiga Fresh, a food farming and distribution business it launched in May 2022. Changing its business strategy in June 2023, Twiga replaced its internal sales team with independent contractors hired and fired based on their performance. Remember that the eCommerce startup announced in November 2022 that it was reducing its 1,000-person workforce. While it did not specify how many employees would be impacted, it stated that by November 30, 2022, it would reduce the benefits for the unaffected ones. Njonjo also refuted the suspension of Twiga's operations in Uganda. He said the company and its farm continue to operate in the country. The X glitch or Elon strikes again Images on X deleted: X, formerly known as Twitter, is not displaying images that were uploaded to the platform before December 2014. What happened? Well, an X user — Tom Coates — posted that all media before December 2014 have been deleted from X servers. Coates said any post pre 2014 that had an image, would just have the text and a broken link to the image. Why did X do this? Well, Coates believes Elon Musk — X's owner — did this as "another cost-saving exercise." This could be true because in June of this year, it was reported that X stopped paying its Google Cloud Bills. Thankfully, Videos were not affected because X allowed posting videos natively on the platform in 2016. Pictures were, however, supported since 2011. Are the pictures lost forever? I don't think so. Some popular images like Ellen Degeneres' selfie from the 2014 Oscars have been restored, but less popular images are just showing as broken links. You can confirm this by taking a look a the comments section on Degeneres' post and you'll see weird t.co links. What is Musk saying? Musk has been unusually silent about the whole thing. But if it turns out this wasn't his doing, I feel bad for whoever is responsible. Last week on Techpoint Africa Who is Bosun Tijani?

Cikü Mugambi replaces Obi Ozor as Kobo360 CEO as GTBank co-founder steps in as board chair Logistics startup, Kobo360, has announced the appointment of Cikü Mugambi as its new CEO, replacing founder, Obi Ozor. Ozor was recently appointed a commissioner of transport in Enugu State, prompting his replacement as CEO and Board chair. Mugambi joined Kobo360 in 2021 as Chief of Staff and Investor Relations, with over a decade of experience at the International Finance Corporation and KPMG. She'll be assisted in her new role by Ayo Fashina as COO. "Powering a complex and challenging supply chain and using technology to scale inter-regional trade, is a long-term, generational mission; this is what Kobo360 set out to achieve when it launched six years ago, and I am honoured to be tasked with continuing the company’s journey," Mugambi shared in a statement. Fola Adeola, the co-founder and former CEO of Guaranty Trust Bank, has also been named chairman of the board of directors. Founded in 2018, Kobo360 provides a platform that connects businesses with trucks for the efficient movement of products. The startup has since grown beyond its Nigerian roots with operations in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, Côte d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. It has also worked with more than 30,000 trucks and 700 businesses and counts the International Finance Corporation, Y Combinator, TLcom Capital Partners, and Goldman Sachs as investors. "My big vision for Kobo360 was always to make an impact on the lives of many, through entrepreneurial innovation, business and economic impact. Alongside my experienced leadership team and Board, I know that we’ve made great strides in achieving this and the work is set to continue, with Cikü, Ayo, and Mr. Fola Adeola now firmly in their new roles. My journey with Kobo360 may be changing, but my commitment to its success remains unwavering," Ozor said about his exit.
Kaduna State bids to woo investors and innovators, as it becomes the first state to domesticate the Nigerian Startup Act On Wednesday, October 19, 2022, former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Nigerian Startup Act into law, a year after stakeholders in Nigeria’s burgeoning startup ecosystem began deliberations. The Act, which saw Nigeria join African countries like Tunisia and Senegal in establishing startup acts, makes certain provisions aimed at stimulating the growth of startups in the country. In the last decade, Nigerian startups have taken centre stage in the country’s economic development, creating jobs, attracting foreign investments, and facilitating the transfer of value. But as anyone doing business in Nigeria knows, growth can often be stalled or hindered by government policies, hence the Startup Act. Despite launching to widespread acclaim, its success largely rests on statewide adoption and collaboration between federating units. As of March 2023, only 12 of the country’s 36 states had indicated an interest in domesticating the Act. These states included Nigeria’s startup capital, Lagos, Kaduna, Kwara, Ekiti, Anambra, Imo, Niger, Nassarawa, Oyo, Rivers, Osun, and Zamfara. Startup Acts: Can the decade’s sexiest law save Nigeria’s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem? Of the twelve, Kaduna State has become the first to domesticate the Act following the signing of a law for the Development of Tech-Enabled Startups in Kaduna State. The state governor, Senator Uba Sani, signed the bill on Wednesday, July 12, 2023. Commenting on the startup act being signed into law, Shuaibu Kabir Bello, Senior Special Assistant on ICT to the Kaduna State Government, said, "The bill is now a law in Kaduna. However, like every law, policy, or plan, government structures and institutions are needed for implementation. This is what Kaduna is doing next." Positioning Kaduna as a leading Startup destination By signing the law, the state hopes to position itself as a leading destination for startups and investors in the country. Much of its provisions mirror the Startup Act, with provisions for the labelling of startups, funding, and talent development. According to a copy of the bill seen by Techpoint Africa, the bill intends to position Kaduna State’s startup ecosystem as the leading digital technology centre in Nigeria; it also hopes to provide an enabling environment for the establishment, development, and operations of startups in Kaduna State. To achieve this goal, the Kaduna State Council for Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship will be established to oversee the execution of the law’s objectives. The council will have twelve members, including the deputy governor and the commissioners for finance, planning and budget, business and innovation. Other members of the council are the Head of the Directorate of Information and Communication Technology, the Managing Director of Kaduna Enterprise Development Agency, the Executive Secretary of Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency, two academicians in related fields, and three representatives from each of the three senatorial zones, one of whom must be a woman. The Kaduna Enterprise Development Agency will serve as the Council’s secretariat. Some of its responsibilities will include labelling startups, coordinating activities between the public and private sectors, maintaining a directory of startups, and advising the Council on the implementation of the law. To be listed in the state’s startup register, a startup must be properly labelled by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) and registered with the Kaduna Enterprise Development Agency. A minimum of 51% of the shares of eligible startups must be owned by at least one Nigerian, while 31% of their employees must be residents of Kaduna State. Furthermore, the startup’s product must either be a new technology or technology-enabled. Commenting on the startup act being signed into law, Shuaibu Kabir Bello, Senior Special Assistant on ICT to the Kaduna State Government, said, "The bill is now a law in Kaduna." A Startups Grants and Investments Fund will also be created to provide funding for early-stage startups and will be funded from the state’s annual budget and the Sovereign Wealth Growth Fund. A minimum of ₦‎250 million will be allocated annually and will be reviewed every three years. Can domesticating the Nigerian Startup Act drive a startup revolution in Kaduna State? Deciding to domesticate the Startup Act is commendable, but simply domesticating the act is not enough. As is frequently pointed out during policy discourses, Nigeria hardly lacks the right laws or policies. Rather, implementation has always posed a challenge, so what hope does Kaduna State have of attracting and retaining startups and investors? Ridwan Abdullateef, a filmmaker and resident of Kaduna State, believes the law could stimulate startup growth in the state. Explaining that there has been a steady growth of tech talent in the last five years, he argues that much of the startup activity in the state takes place in tech hubs or incubation centres. However, the government must provide certain incentives to attract founders. “The first and the most obvious one is funding. Every startup founder needs funds. They need to be able to say, 'I have this amount in my account to run my startup for a certain number of months.” But even with adequate funding for startups, attracting talent to the state could depend on the state’s security status. A Q1 2023 security report revealed that 214 people were killed in violent attacks, with 746 abducted, and that will be a concern for potential residents of the state. “We have guys coming from Abuja and they say things like, ‘How do you guarantee our safety?’” Talent development is another challenge the state will face on this journey. While the newly signed law provides for the creation of training programmes, it may be a while before it starts to see results. “The pool of candidates we currently have in Kaduna may not be adequate for more than three startups. What we currently have is enough for the level Kaduna is at, but the onus will have to be on the startups [that come to the state] to train others.” The lower cost of living when compared to cities like Lagos and Abuja could also attract more tech workers to the state. For example, a two-bedroom apartment in most parts of Lagos rents for ₦‎850,000 on average, but the same apartment in most parts of Kaduna could be gotten for half that amount. As exciting as this could be, the government must look to examples from other states in Nigeria. In 2020, Sim Shagaya moved part of his uLesson team to Jos, the capital of Plateau State. At the time, he called it the smartest decision he had ever taken, but by December, the company had ended that experiment. "Our ability to develop for and distribute to this African market means we have to move to a city with better regional flight connections and to which we can easier attract the talent we need," the company explained. Similarly, despite starting out with a dream to build a tech talent pipeline from Ile-Ife, TalentQL eventually moved bases less than two years after, while the Kaduna State technology city commissioned by the previous governor has seen mixed success. These developments show the difficulty startups that move outside Lagos often face. Even moving away from startups, digital economy plans by states have often remained plans with little progress made. With Nominal Gross Domestic Product standing at ₦‎3.1 trillion as of 2020, Kaduna State is one of the largest economies in Nigeria and could be attractive to investors, but it must fix certain issues to be viewed as a credible alternative to Lagos, Abuja, or Port Harcourt. The success of startups like Sudo Africa points to the potential of Kaduna State to support the development of tech startups. Ultimately, collaborations between the government and private sector will be crucial.
You can now send HD photos on WhatsApp Remember how I told you I wouldn’t eat Snickers this week? Well, I bought two chocolate bars yesterday. While I couldn’t resist the urge not to buy them from the store, I didn’t eat them because I told you I wouldn’t. Telling you helped. So, I want to thank you. Were you at the Nigerian Fintech Executive Mixer, organised by Intelpoint? If you were, you'd agree it was an opportunity for networking and relaxation. I enjoyed my time and also ate and drank to my heart's content. Missed it? Be on the lookout for Intelpoint’s next event. The editorial team discussed several stories on this week's Techpoint Africa podcast, including Jumia recording a decrease in losses in Nigeria, loan app agents revealing companies' unethical practices, and Bosun Tijani's ministerial confirmation. Watch it here. It’s the weekend, and I’ve got plans. Do you have one? Please, don’t forget to exercise! Document your fun and boring memories. I’m honestly trying to be good at that. Please, have fun this weekend. Here's what I've got for you today: Moniepoint expands its services to everyone You can now send HD photos on WhatsApp Moniepoint expands its services to everyone Nigerian fintech company, Moniepoint, wants to offer its banking and payments offerings to everyone, not just businesses. Consequently, the company has launched a consumer app and debit cards. This move puts the company in direct competition with businesses like OPay and PalmPay. The fintech will provide Moniepoint Microfinance Bank debit cards, which payment giants such as Mastercard and Verve will issue. The consumer app allows users to transfer money, pay bills, and buy airtime, and its debit cards can be used online, at PoS terminals, and at ATMs. Moneiepoint is rolling out an automated dispute resolution system that allows users to log complaints about unsuccessful card transactions and track them until they receive a complete reversal within 48 hours. This complies with the CBN's chargeback regulations, which demand a 48-hour reversal period. Sidebar: In June 2023, Google Cloud partnered with Moniepoint to provide financial services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in suburban areas. You can now send HD photos on WhatsApp I avoid sending photos via WhatsApp like the plague. You and I know how the messaging platform reduces the quality of an image or a video. Plus, sharing images as a document on the platform can be challenging, especially if you’re sending or receiving many pictures or using an iPhone. That means you have to open each document to view them. However, I’ve come bearing good news: You can now share photos via WhatsApp without losing their quality. WhatsApp is introducing a HD feature that will allow you to keep the high-def resolution of photos you share with anyone. Before using the new feature, you must update your app to the most recent version. Then, you will notice a new "HD" button above the other image editing tools like rotate and those for adding text and stickers to the picture. A new pop-up that lets you choose the photo quality will appear when you tap the HD button. While Standard Quality is the default choice, you can check HD quality to keep the high-definition version of the image. When you send a photo, a HD label will appear in the bottom left corner, notifying the recipient that you have shared a higher-quality image. What’s more, WhatsApp will make this feature available for videos in the coming weeks.

Lessons on building an MVP at Pitch Friday Ideas are a dime a dozen, and almost everyone who follows the startup space has an idea that they think will be as big as Facebook. But the devil is in the execution, and moving from an idea to a product is a tough proposition for many prospective founders. To make this process easier, founders are often advised to start with a minimum viable product, also known as an MVP. Product Plan defines an MVP as “a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle.” Building an MVP was the subject of a presentation at Pitch Friday. Nnamdi Azodo, a product manager at Mastercard, and the facilitator of the session, began with a simple message for the audience: think big but start small. “Have all the grand ideas. Think about how to solve all the world’s problems and change the world, but start small. If you don’t, you’ll end up continuing to build. What is the simplest version of your product that will solve the most pressing needs of your users?” Sharing his experience as a founding member of the ALAT team, he explained that founders could easily find themselves adding so many features to a product from the start. However, the goal of building an MVP should be solving an important problem and getting user feedback. After Azodo’s session, we moved on to the startup pitches. Easeplan, an event management startup co-founded by Ekekenta Clinton and Caleb Benjamin. Planning an event often requires that you coordinate several processes. You may need to find a venue or vendors to provide certain items. Easeplan ensures that all these services are accessible on one platform. Users can either sign up as users or as professionals looking to deliver a service. After verification, they begin providing services or hiring event professionals. Easeplan charges a 10% fee for every transaction it facilitates. Getting on the platform as a service provider only happens after extensive checks by the Easeplan team. Where service providers do not meet a user’s requirements, Easeplan issues a refund to the buyer after verifying their claims. After his pitch, he fielded questions and got recommendations from the audience on the business model and ensuring service quality. Olamide Bamiro was the next, pitching Steelers Gaming. Although he was unwilling to disclose the startup’s first game, he stated that the goal was to create educational games that could be played on mobile devices by users of all ages. When it is launched, the company hopes to make money by placing ads within the game, charging a subscription fee, and enabling in-app payments. Like Clinton, Bamiro fielded questions from the audience, with most of them revolving around his opinion that building an MVP was not suitable for the gaming sector. However, Azodo pointed out that all products could have an MVP, as the goal was not perfection, but solving an important need. Pitch Friday is held every second Friday of the month, and you can register to attend or pitch your startup by following this link.
Daunting tasks ahead as Bosun Tijani is confirmed minister of communications, innovation, and the digital economy Bosun Tijani, the tech entrepreneur and co-founder of CcHub, has been appointed as Nigeria's Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy. His appointment, with a few exceptions, breathes much-needed industry experience into President Tinubu’s newly minted ministerial cabinet. As Tijani steps into this new position, he faces a series of unseen challenges that extend beyond the tech startup ecosystem he helped build. Bosun Tijani's tech journey spans academia and industry. His robust academic background includes a diploma in Computer Science, a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Jos, a Master's from Warwick Business School, and a PhD in Innovation and Economic Development from the University of Leicester. Tijani has made significant contributions to the tech space. As CcHUB’s leader, Tijani transformed it from a local hub in Yaba to a pan-African tech incubator, empowering young entrepreneurs across the continent. He leads a billion naira growth fund for early-stage founders. He's orchestrated landmark events, such as Mark Zuckerberg's first visit to Nigeria and a meetup with Bill Gates. His landmark appointment, however, presents a series of unique challenges. Navigating Bureaucratic Red Tape Tijani's fast-paced startup background contrasts with the complex government system in Nigeria. Everything from process to speech is quite...different. In many democratic societies, Nigeria included, open government criticism is seen as a fundamental right, but how the critique is received varies. Tijani has already had to apologise for past critical tweets during the senate ministerial screening. His ability to understand the system, build relationships with politicians and civil servants with different interests, and translate innovative ideas into policies that will actually be implemented are key challenges. Nigeria's President signs startup bill into law: Here's what it means for tech companies, investors, and employees Managing expectations across the tech ecosystem While the startup community largely applaud Tijani’s appointment, they’re just a part of Nigeria’s technology ecosystem. He will also have to deal with the companies providing the infrastructure that powers the digital economy. Telecoms, data centres, cable providers, satellite internet providers, and traditional logistics companies. Unlike the previous minister, Isa Ali Pantami, Tijani is seen as an outsider by some players in the telecom industry. Issues such as multiple taxation, right of way, and vandalism currently plague the sector, and all eyes will be on him to see how he resolves these issues. There is, however, some benefit to being an outsider. Global technology provider, IBM, showed this in 1993 when they brought in Lou Gerstner, who had a background in the tobacco industry. Bosun could bring in that outsider perspective to challenge the status quo. His presence could foster a synergy between several established companies in the space and tech startups. The success of his strategies will lie in a key component. How increased Right of Way charges could raise data and voice call tariffs Overseeing key parastatals: A complex task The minister of communications and the digital economy oversees parastatals including: Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) Galaxy backbone (GBB) Nigerian Communications Satellite Ltd (NigComSat) Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC) This oversight presents a complex task: Working with Experienced Heads: Collaborating with experienced figures at the NCC, NITDA and NIPOST is not going to be challenging. The President may appoint new heads for these parastatals. Who they are, and Tijani's ability to work with the new leadership will be critical factors. It’s worth noting that Bosun has worked with various government parastatals and served in committees in the past to varying degrees of success. Working from inside will be a different test. Many infrastructures that startups rely on, such as the Internet, logistics, and digital identity, are tied to these parastatals. Tijani's leadership and collaboration with these entities will have far-reaching implications for the startup ecosystem. He will have to embark on the delicate dance of striking the right balance between encouraging technological innovation within these parastatals and maintaining regulatory stability. Tijani's appointment as Minister of Communications and Digital Economy is a landmark moment for Nigeria's tech ecosystem. However, he faces multifaceted issues and his ability to resolve them could make or mar his time as minister, and the experience for Nigerians. Stay tuned for a deeper analysis of these challenges in our upcoming feature article. If you would love to offer expert insights, please hit me at emmanuel@techpoint.africa.
Takealot tests an on-demand service in Cape Town It’s not Friday yet, but I’m excited. Guess why? Today is Intelpoint’s — Techpoint Africa's research and data arm — Fintech Executive Mixer. It’s happening at Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, on Thursday, August 17, 2023. Techpoint Africa will also host The Modern Workplace Africa Conference on Saturday, October 21, 2023, at Landmark Centre in Victoria Island, Lagos. You should attend this event whether you are an employer or employee, a HR enthusiast or expert, a remote or 9 to 5 worker, a techie or trying to transition into tech, or you don’t even have a job. This event will be empowering, and I’m not even joking. To attend, please, register here. Here's what I've got for you today: M-PESA is now live in Ethiopia AWS Skills Center in South Africa Takealot to launch an on-demand service M-PESA is now live in Ethiopia Safaricom rolled out M-PESA in Ethiopia yesterday to help increase revenue from its operations in the country and support its goal of turning a profit by 2027. Why? The cost of launching operations in Ethiopia in October 2022 caused Safaricom's core earnings to decline by 5% in March 2023. Ethio Telecom, whose profits more than doubled in its most recent fiscal year, is a fierce competitor for the company. Its mobile money service, Telebirr, reported over 34 million subscribers as of July. In May 2023, Safaricom obtained a Payment Instrument Issuer Licence from the National Bank of Ethiopia to launch its mobile money service, M-PESA, in the country. If you’re wondering why it didn’t launch until yesterday, the company said it had to complete a demanding three-month pilot and testing phase as well as technical readiness, secure significant bank partnerships, and hire, train, and onboard M-PESA agents. Customers can pay for goods and services, purchase airtime, transfer and send money, and receive money domestically and internationally using the mobile money service. Safaricom Ethiopia customers can use M-PESA services by dialling *733# on their line on both Android and iOS devices. The app currently supports five languages for Android smartphones and is accessible via the Google Play Store; it will be made available for IOS phones in the upcoming weeks. M-PESA isn’t only in Kenya or Ethiopia. The mobile money service is also available in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Tanzania. AWS opens Skills Center in South Africa Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched its first African Skills Center in Cape Town, South Africa. The new centre will offer free education programmes to non-technical workers. What's the AWS Skills Center? It's a specialised, on-site cloud learning facility designed by Amazon for anyone interested in cloud computing, potential career paths within the industry, and developing the skills required to advance their professional aspirations. This facility in Cape Town is the company’s third AWS Skills Center in the world. Its other two centres are in Arlington (Virginia) and Seattle (Washington), both in the United States. Why South Africa? AWS Training and Certification Vice President, Maureen Lonergan, said there is a wealth of talent in Cape Town and that upskilling the workforce can help foster innovation, ignite economic growth, and speed up digital transformation in South Africa. Takealot to launch an on-demand service South African eCommerce platform, Takealot, is testing TakealotNOW, an on-demand service in Cape Town that will allow it to deliver any of its products to its customers within an hour. Takealot Group’s delivery service, Mr D, will handle the logistics and deliver several items until 11 p.m. Additionally, the first month's delivery is free. The service will initially be available only in the northern suburbs of Cape Town, specifically Durbanville, Belville, Brackenfell, Kraaifontein, Kuilsriver, and Parow. But there are plans to expand Why is Takealot doing this? Apart from the accelerated adoption of online retail in South Africa due to the impact of COVID-19, one thing comes to mind: Project Fela. Project Fela is the codename given to Amazon’s expansion project into Africa, including South Africa. Consequently, the South African online retailer might be launching TakealotNOW to maintain a larger market share even if Amazon opens a local marketplace. Makwe Masilela, Chief Investment Officer of Makwe Fund Managers, added that Takealot's entry into the on-demand service market is a good one, particularly given the success it has already brought to South Africa's grocery retailers.

Safaricom launches M-PESA three months after obtaining an operating licence in Ethiopia Safaricom has today launched its mobile money service, M-PESA, in Ethiopia. This move comes three months after obtaining a Payment Instrument Issuer Licence from the National Bank of Ethiopia. The three months saw M-PESA complete a demanding three-month pilot and testing phase, complete technical readiness, secure significant bank partnerships, and hire, train, and onboard M-PESA agents. BusinessDaily reported in July that Safaricom would roll out M-PESA in Ethiopia by September 2023 to help increase revenue from its Ethiopian operations and support its goal of turning a profit by 2027. The cost of launching operations in Ethiopia caused Safaricom's core earnings to decline by 5% in the year ending March. Ethio Telecom, whose profits more than doubled in its most recent fiscal year, is another fierce competitor for the company. For its mobile money service, Telebirr, the Ethiopian telco reported having over 34 million subscribers as of July. Customers can pay for goods and services, purchase airtime, transfer money to their bank accounts, send money from their bank accounts to their M-PESA, and receive money domestically and internationally using the mobile money service. Since the Kenyan telco launched in Ethiopia in 2022, over 2 million active users have signed up for Safaricom's voice and data network. Safaricom Ethiopia customers can use M-PESA services by dialling *733# on their Safaricom line on both Android and iOS devices. The app is currently prepared in five languages for Android devices and is accessible via the Google Play store; it will be made available for IOS devices in the upcoming weeks. In 2007, the telco launched M-PESA in Kenya and is available in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Lesotho, Mozambique and Tanzania. Safaricom Ethiopia announced on August 7, 2023, that it would receive $257.4 million (KSh36.8 billion) in World Bank Group funding to support the telco's greenfield telecommunications projects. Besides, the telco shut down its sites in Amhara, Ethiopia’s second-largest region, two weeks ago. It came after the federal government declared a six-month state of emergency in the area on August 4, 2023, due to a crisis between the military and the Fano militia, a part-time militia with no formal command structure.
Cryptocurrency fraud is the easiest to investigate - Adedeji Owonibi Key takeaways: Adedeji Owonibi, Founder and CEO of Convexity, a blockchain hub, has said law enforcement should not look down on cryptocurrencies as they're easy to investigate. Owonibi said this at the Stakeholders Policy Dialogue hosted by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) in collaboration with Stakeholders in the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN). He emphasised that law enforcement needs to understand crypto education as much as regulators. During the stakeholder's policy dialogue on the implementation of the national blockchain policy, Adedeji Owonibi, Convexity CEO and crypto forensic expert, spoke on the importance of blockchain education for regulators and law enforcement. On the panel, Improving the Blockchain Regulatory Landscape for an Effective Financial Inclusion, Owonibi pointed out that proper regulation includes training law enforcement on cryptocurrencies and blockchain. While there's a lot of focus on regulatory bodies when it comes to the blockchain space, Owonibi believes law enforcement agencies are an important layer of blockchain regulation. In a practical example, Owonibi said two of his developers were arrested on suspicion of being fraudsters because they had laptops in their possession. To reduce this, Owonibi and his team have conducted trainings at several Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) offices across the country. Interestingly, he revealed that "cryptocurrency or bitcoin [fraud] is the easiest to investigate." He added that law enforcement officials should become familiar with it. Why crypto fraud is easy to investigate Crypto transactions happen on a public blockchain, making it easy to track illicit ones. The only hard part is putting a face to the transactions. For example, if you visit etherscan.io — a website for tracking transactions on the Ethereum blockchain — and enter a crypto address, you can see the balance on the address and transactions that have taken place on the account. How to put a face to crypto transactions Owonibi explained that while the blockchain lacks know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, it is possible to put a face to a wallet because one way or the other, the tokens will find their way to a centralised exchange where KYC protocols are necessary. When crypto scams are done, the perpetrators need a way to turn the crypto tokens into fiat currency. One of the ways to do this is by selling them on a centralised exchange. Unlike decentralised exchanges or non-custodial wallets where you can open a crypto wallet without KYC, a centralised exchange requires users to identify themselves. However, there is also the option of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, which means perpetrators will sell their tokens for cash instead of going through a centralised exchange. OTC merchants usually need to take funds back to an exchange, which means the illicit tokens will be tracked to them and subsequently the person from whom they purchased the tokens. "Even the OTC merchant needs to know who sold him crypto or he could be roped in the crime. Many are cooling with EFCC for that. So now, they'll even ask for an ID," Owonibi explained. Tracking big crypto scams can still be difficult Big scammers employ more sophisticated efforts to throw regulators and law enforcement off their track. One of the ways they do this is through crypto mixers or "tumblers" which are used to hide the origin and destination of crypto tokens." Law enforcement will only see the crypto go into the mixer and come out through many ends that are not necessarily connected to the original sender. Some of the most popular mixers are Wasabi Wallet and Tornado Cash. Although mixers make it difficult to track transactions, law enforcement agencies have been known to track transactions hidden with mixers. According to Owonibi, the $1.7 billion scam run by South African, Cornelius Steynberg, was hidden through the Wasabi Wallet mixer, but it was tracked by the US government. A key to catching all scammers on the blockchain In 2022, Owonibi revealed to Techpoint Africa that the anonymity in the blockchain space would not be that way forever, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — an intergovernmental organisation founded to combat money laundering — is working to put a face to blockchain transactions. "It is called the travel rule protocol or travel rule standard. We've [Owonibi and the FATF] been working on it since 2019 and have developed a standard called IVMS 101, and over 130 of us globally worked together to bring out that standard." In the meantime, Owonibi said he's engaging and educating the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other regulators in the country on cryptocurrency and blockchain. Suleiman Garba, a member of Monument Applications Limited's Advisory Board who was also on the same panel as Owonibi during the stakeholder's policy dialogue, pointed out that stakeholders need to engage with regulators and show them what blockchain technology can do. "Globally, regulators are expected to be technologically neutral. They are not keen on the technology, they are looking at what the technology does," said Garba. According to the NITDA DG, Kashifu Inuwa, blockchain technology can add $40 billion to Nigeria's GDP if harnessed properly. From the CBN's eNaira to NITDA's national blockchain policy, things bode well for blockchain in the country.
TikTok ban in Kenya? While writing this introduction, the song, It's A Beautiful Day by Michael Bublé came to mind. Even though this intro is about YouTube Music, I went to YouTube to watch the video. You can check out the song here. Here’s the news: YouTube Music is introducing Samples, a new TikTok-style short-form personalised video feed. Each video in the feed provides a brief overview of the song's recommended artist, music video, and mood. Users can find songs and music videos by swiping vertically in the new Samples feed, similar to TikTok. In addition to assisting users in finding new music, YouTube Music uses short-form video clips to encourage the discovery of long-form video content on the platform. Users can add songs to their libraries, share them with others, make playlists, visit album pages, launch new radio stations, or use the songs to create Shorts while scrolling through the feed. Here's what I've got for you today: Court bars Worldcoin from collecting data from Kenyans Airtel Money follows M-PESA's lead TikTok ban in Kenya? Court bars Worldcoin from collecting data from Kenyans A Kenyan high court has ordered Worldcoin to stop collecting data from Kenyans while the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC)'s investigation is ongoing. It follows the filing of a lawsuit by the ODPC asking the court to prevent Worldcoin from transferring or processing data collected from Kenyans. What is Worldcoin? It is a cryptocurrency project that scans people's eyes to create a global financial database for humans. Before now, it collected Kenyans’ biometric information by taking pictures of their irises in exchange for KSh 7,000 ($50) or 25 World (WLD) tokens. The ODPC said Worldcoin's processing of personal data does not follow the guidelines for data protection outlined in Section 25 of the Data Protection Act. Consequently, Justice Nixon Sifuna ordered Worldcoin to preserve the data it collected from Kenyans between April 19 and August 8 while the government agency conducts its investigation. While Worldcoin contends that it will use the collected data to create a unique, secure form of identification, privacy experts expressed concern that the business might use the data in other ways, like personalised marketing. On August 2, 2023, Kenya's Ministry of Interior and National Administration suspended the activities of Worldcoin. Want to know more about Worldcoin? Read Bolu’s article here: Why are Kenyans scanning their eyes for $50? 11 questions about Worldcoin answered Airtel Money follows M-PESA's lead What’s going on in the Kenyan mobile money space? Two days ago, Safaricom announced that the daily transaction cap for its mobile money service, M-PESA, would increase to KSh 500,000. Well, Airtel Money Kenya has also disclosed an increase in daily transaction limit from KSh 300,000 to KSh 500,000. Managing Director of Airtel Money in Kenya, Anne Kinuthia-Otieno, said the change would give customers and partners more flexibility to conduct larger transactions and manage their finances more effectively. Just like M-PESA, Airtel Money customers can only send KSh 150,000 at once. I expect Telkom Kenya's mobile money service, T-Kash, to follow suit. If you're wondering why, Airtel currently holds a 3.4% market share for mobile money in Kenya. It trails Safaricom's M-PESA, which has the highest market share with 96.5%. Telkom Kenya’s T-Kash comes in third at 0.1%. If we were going by market share, T-Kash would announce its daily increase today. But that’s just me speculating. I’d let you know if Telkom Kenya discloses the increase. Sidebar: Kenya's mobile money subscriptions dropped from 38.6 million in the previous quarter to 38.4 million in March 2023. Penetration rate is now 76.0%, down 2.2% from the last quarter. This decrease is due to the decline in mobile money service activity during the quarter. TikTok ban in Kenya? Briget Connect Consultancy CEO, Bob Ndolo, has submitted a petition to National Assembly Speaker, Moses Wetang'ula, asking to ban TikTok in Kenya. Why? The petitioner has complained that the social media platform's content is inappropriate and promotes violence, foul language, explicit sexual content, and hate speech, endangering Kenya's cultural and religious values. The petitioner also said that TikTok had shared user data with third parties without users’ consent. In addition, he warned that if Kenya does not outlaw the app, TikTok will impair their academic performance and cause their mental health to suffer, leading to issues like depression and anxiety. However, the Majority Leader, Kimani Ichung'wah, argued there’s nothing wrong with using TikTok and that many lawmakers do so. He stated that Ndolo should have petitioned the House to investigate how to regulate the use of social media apps and how the ICT department can regulate the content because “outright banning would be killing careers.” Opiyo Wandayi, the Minority Leader, agreed, stating that given the high unemployment rate in Kenya and the difficult times the country is experiencing, Kenya can't function independently in the digital age. Sidebar Alert: On August 2, 2023, the Ministry of Information, Communication, and the Digital Economy of Kenya announced it would review the laws protecting social media users. He also expressed concern about the current trend of TikTok users going live between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. and sharing explicit content.

Court orders Worldcoin not to transfer or process data collected from Kenyans Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) has filed a lawsuit to prohibit Worldcoin from transferring or processing data collected from Kenyans. Worldcoin is a cryptocurrency project that scans people's eyes to create a global financial database for humans. According to the ODPC, the Worldcoin project's processing of personal data does not follow the guidelines for data protection outlined in Section 25 of the Act. In an affidavit, Oscar Otieno, the Deputy Data Commissioner, says that after reviewing the Worldcoin project operations in the country, he is confident that it is unsafe for Kenyans and that additional research is ongoing. Justice Nixon Sifuna ordered Worldcoin to preserve the data it collected from Kenyans between April 19 and August 8 while the government agency conducts its investigation. Worldcoin collects Kenyans’ biometric information by taking pictures of their irises in exchange for KSh 7,000 ($50) or 25 World tokens. While Worldcoin contends that it will use the collected data to create a unique, secure form of identification, privacy experts expressed concern that the business might use the data in other ways, like personalised marketing. “Despite the suspension and directive to cease processing of personal data, the respondents continued to process the said personal data. It took the public directive by the CS Interior to halt their operations on August 2,” Otieno says. For context, on August 2, 2023, Kenya's Ministry of Interior and National Administration suspended the activities of Worldcoin. On August 7, 2023, Kenyan law enforcement officers raided a warehouse on Mombasa Road in Nairobi and seized equipment they believed contained data gathered by Worldcoin. Why are Kenyans scanning their eyes for $50? 11 questions about Worldcoin answered The team reportedly took the equipment to the main office of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for additional inspection.
Jumia could soon roll out buy now, pay later solution in Egypt Jumia is developing buy now, pay later solutions for consumers in partnership with third parties. The service, which could launch in Egypt, has already inked partnerships with 10 banks and fintechs in the North African country. As part of a move to drive adoption of the JumiaPay app, the company's partners will be responsible for credit underwriting and loan disbursement. Jumia is also working on increasing the number of payment options available on the JumiaPay app, even as it seeks to launch JumiaPay on delivery in Ghana, Morocco, and Uganda. Although the number of JumiaPay transactions declined by 38%, the company reports that half of post-paid transactions in Kenya for Q2 2023 were completed using JumiaPay. It's also pursuing a strategy that will see it facilitate payments for third parties by providing them with a white-label solution. Investors believe floating the naira could drive venture capital investments in Nigeria In its relentless pursuit to cut costs, the company laid off some staff in 2022 and shut down some services. However, it has seen a year-over-year decline in quarterly active consumers, orders, and gross merchandise value. "The average inflation level across our footprint reached 14.1% in June 2023, with highs of 42.5% and 35.7% registered in Ghana and Egypt, respectively. In Nigeria, inflation rose to an 18-year high of 22.8% in June 2023," the company said in its Q2 2023 report. In June 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced that it was unifying the country's exchange rate. That immediately sent the naira into a tailspin. The Kenyan shilling has also lost significant value when benchmarked against the US dollar and contributed to Jumia's GMV decline. The company is also doubling down on efforts to increase the lifetime value of its customers. Products such as airtime recharge that required heavy promotion have been discontinued in favor of products with healthy unit economics that drive repeat purchases.
Lifelong friends score $10,000 grant to create borderless pharmacies in Nigeria At the Pitch2Win 2023 competition in July, Pharmarun, a Nigerian healthtech startup, competed against 14 startups from different industries, including fintech, eCommerce, AI, and blockchain, and emerged winner, going home with $10,000 in equity-free funding. Pitch2Win is an accelerator investment startup competition designed to help early-stage Nigerian companies raise capital and expand. Companies from several industries can enter the competition, and the winners will receive funding, access to an investor network, legal services, and mentorship. Pharmarun's Co-founders — Teniola Adedeji (CEO) and Funmilola Aderemi (CPO) — felt validated for their contributions in the healthtech space and said they would use the funds to improve and expand their pharmacy network and acquire new customers. Interestingly, while taking me through their journey, they revealed that they have been best friends for 20 years. Launching a company with a friend can be rewarding and challenging. On the one hand, your pre-existing relationship and trust can help with decision-making and communication, which will benefit the venture in its early stages. On the other hand, navigating personal dynamics can be challenging because conflicts happen. To resolve any issues quickly, it may be necessary to have open and honest communication. 5 things to consider before going into business with your friend However, the best friends appear to have discovered a workaround because Pharmarun is not their first company together. Passionate about giving gifts, they founded Fairy Sisters in 2016, an on-demand personalised card company, that allowed users to upload photos to cards online and have a physical copy delivered. Users could browse inspirational messages, set reminders for birthdays and important dates, and upload photos directly from their phones to cards, mugs, key chai, and other items using the Fairy Sisters web app. In 2018, they switched the tech component to a more interactive service and they actively ran it till 2020. They made many collaborative gifts, personalised bridal gifts, and many other items, for clients including Lori, Seamfix, and FDHL. How Pharmarun was born After completing her pharmacy degree at the University of Lagos in 2013, Adedeji worked for the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) between 2014 and 2015. In 2016, she completed an internship in investment banking at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch before continuing with her pharmacy career. Between 2016 and 2020, she worked at Invivo Health, Rozec Pharmacy, and Medquare Pharmacy, where she identified a problem that would later birth Pharmarun. Adedeji noticed that it was challenging for some customers to find the exact medication they needed, necessitating multiple store visits or trips to a specific town or city. "So you would have someone come into my store and say, 'I have gone to five stores. Please, I hope you have what I need.’ It was just a chore. It was not the best experience for anyone, let alone someone sick." At the time, there was no platform connecting people to pharmacies, allowing them easy access to medications because the customers didn’t know where to look. She decided to launch Pharmarun because she knew the right pharmacies to visit for several medicines, saving patients time without aggravating their condition. Additionally, the need for such a service increased in 2020 due to the pandemic. She also didn’t know there was such a large market for it until she began offering medications on demand via WhatsApp. Fun fact: Adedeji, who had always wanted to own a retail pharmacy, came up with the logo — medicine on wheels — and business name in 2016. As she started toying with the concept, she registered the business in 2020. While Adedeji was ensuring customer satisfaction and procurements as operations manager at Rozec Pharmacy in 2017, Aderemi began her product journey in the same year at Seamfix, an identity and verification company. There, she supported, marketed, built, and managed products for banks. She left for MAX, a Nigerian mobility tech platform, in 2021, where she worked as a senior product manager, managing the engineering team and developing products for asset management. Adedeji would contact Aderemi late at night while building Pharmarun's first website. Soon, she naturally transitioned from MAX to Pharmarun full-time by the end of the year. Building pharmacies without borders Pharmarun makes medications available to people in Nigeria, wherever and whenever they need them. You can order medications via its website and get them delivered to your destination within three hours after payment in some parts of Nigeria, including Lagos, Ogun, Port Harcourt, and Abuja at prices Aderemi says are competitive. You can also order over the phone, by email, or on social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. Delivery could take between 24 and 48 hours in states where licensed pharmacies are scarce, such as most of Nigeria's northern states. Interestingly, Aderemi says that most of its customers in these areas do not care about delivery times and only want guaranteed access to the drugs which Pharmarun provides. The company partners with several pharmacies and logistics companies in some parts of Nigeria to make delivery possible. So customers can buy medication on the platform for the same price they would pay in their neighbourhood. The additional cost is the delivery fee. Aderemi maintains that Pharmarun has a system in place to confirm the validity of the prescriptions they receive. In a country where 14.4%, or 14.3 million people between the ages of 15 and 64, abuse drugs, Pharmarun is run by licensed pharmacists who obtain prescriptions from patients and verify them before delivering them. For example, if a customer orders via a social media platform such as WhatsApp, the pharmacist will ask patient-specific questions to confirm their prescription or symptoms and ensure they are requesting the appropriate medication. “Before you can complete payment on some medications, it must be reviewed by the pharmacist. Our review process takes five minutes. There's nothing long. But it's not all medications that you can check out on Pharmarun because the pharmacist needs to look at them,” Aderemi clarifies. She also emphasises that most of its customers order medications such as multivitamins and ibuprofen, which they do not typically abuse. However, for drugs that appear "sensitive," a pharmacist review is required. For a returning customer, she says the company has their history and can call them to flag or approve it. Pharmarun employs a B2B2C business model and concentrates on end users. It assists businesses, such as hospitals, insurance companies, and startups, to reach their consumers. The company offers the Buy Now, Pay Later option, allowing its fintech partner to give out loans to customers to pay in instalments or visit specific stores and pay later. While the core of the business is to deliver medication to people anywhere in Nigeria, Pharmarun also provides automated refills, which allow a customer to visit the platform and select a monthly delivery option for their medication. This service will be valuable to patients with chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, psychosis, coronary heart diseases, and asthma. It also offers a service to encourage complete drug adherence for people with infectious and non-infectious diseases. Customers can also consult pharmacists for free on the company's website without signing up and check several health metrics such as body mass index (BMI), calories, and ovulation. Flourishing in a challenging environment as a pharmacy aggregator Aggregating several pharmacies, which allows anyone in Nigeria to use its platform, distinguishes Pharmarun from competitors such as OneHealth, a Nigerian pharmaceutical healthtech company. Meanwhile, convincing pharmacies to come on board using its technology has been challenging for the startup. “The major thing is our technology. It does a lot more than what you have on the market today. We want Pharmarun to power a lot of businesses. So, the company is not solely focused on reaching the end-users. "Our different tiers of pharmacies differ from those available in the market today, which are online pharmacies, but ours is a service offering. It’s more robust than eCommerce platforms,” Adedeji expatiates. Pharmacies — aside from the tech-savvy ones — do not comprehend how Pharmarun onboards them. So, Aderemi reveals the startup has developed fantastic onboarding programmes and benefits to address the issue. Consequently, Pharmarun is expanding its network so that it can cater for a more diverse set of pharmacies. Pharmarun, which has previously received outside investment from Fedha Capital, intends to raise a pre-seed round of $500,000 for development and customer acquisition. Aderemi states that over 28,000 people have used the startup's service since it launched, and by the end of 2023, they hope to double that number. The company currently has a 15-man team but hopes to grow to 25 before the end of the year. Pharmarun, which currently generates over $18,000 in monthly revenue, says it is building pharmacies without borders. Therefore, the business intends to completely enter all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory before extending to other African nations over the next five years. A big part of its strategy will involve working with tech companies or starting from scratch, depending on the issue it uncovers from a comprehensive market research study. The company seeks to make it easier for people to obtain necessary medical supplies, whether pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical.
Following M-PESA's lead, Kenya's Airtel Money has increased daily transaction limits Following approval from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), Airtel Money Kenya has announced it will increase its daily transaction limit from KSh 300,000 to KSh 500,000. This move comes after Safaricom's announcement that the daily transaction cap for its mobile money service, M-PESA, would increase to KSh 500,000. Managing Director of Airtel Money in Kenya, Anne Kinuthia-Otieno, called the move positive because it will benefit the Kenyan economy. She said the change would give customers and partners more flexibility to conduct larger transactions and manage their finances more effectively. “Businesses can now conduct their operations more conveniently, and efficiently, and consumers can access a wider range of goods and services, contributing to economic growth, job creation, and improved financial stability in Kenya,” Kinuthia-Otieno said. However, Airtel Money customers can only send KSh 150,000 at once. Airtel currently holds a 3.4% market share for mobile money in Kenya. It now occupies second place after Safaricom's M-PESA, which has the highest market share with 96.5%. Telkom Kenya’s T-Kash comes in third at 0.1%. Airtel Kenya recently disclosed that it had tripled the number of mobile money agents working for it and aimed to reach 120,000 agents by the end of 2023. Further, Kenya's mobile money subscriptions dropped from 38.6 million in the previous quarter to 38.4 million in March 2023. The penetration rate is now 76.0%, down 2.2% from the last quarter. The decline in mobile money service activity during the reviewed quarter caused the penetration rate to decrease. In October 2022, Airtel Kenya officially separated from its mobile money business, Airtel Money. The Central Bank of Kenya emphasised that the change will benefit payment service providers (PSPs) the most because it will allow PSPs to shield their CBK-regulated activities from shocks brought on by other commercial activities.
Safaricom will raise M-PESA users' daily transaction caps to support SMEs in Kenya Safaricom plans to increase M-Pesa account and daily transaction limits to KSh 500,000 for all customers on August 15, 2023. This move follows the Central Bank of Kenya’s approval. Safaricom CEO, Peter Ndegwa, says the increase in account limits is consistent with the company’s commitment to offering customers simple and reliable mobile money services. He also states that as the share of cashless transactions keeps increasing, the higher account limits will offer customers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), greater convenience. In 2021, a survey by Amethyst Consultants on "SMEs perceptions of banking products and how M-Pesa is driving SME payments" reportedly shows that 9 out of 10 SMEs, or 95%, use the mobile money service. Further, M-Pesa customers will benefit from an increase in the daily transaction limit from KSh 300,000 to KSh 500,000. Although Kenyans can now transact up to KSh 500,000 per day, the telco mentioned that the current per-transaction cap of KSh 150,000 would remain in place. For more than 606,000 businesses, Lipa Na M-Pesa processed KSh 1.625 trillion transactions during the previous fiscal year, which ran from March 2022 to March 20223. In 2020, M-Pesa launched several products and services, including the M-Pesa business app, USSD codes for merchants, and micro SME wallet, to empower and assist SMEs grow.
Founders Factory Africa secures $114 million to address gender imbalance in the VC ecosystem Founders Factory Africa, an early-stage investor based in South Africa, has raised $114 million to provide operational support for its investments across the continent. The Mastercard Foundation and Johnson & Johnson Impact Ventures contributed to the investment. Founded in 2018 by Bongani Sithole and Alina Truhina, the company invests in innovative early-stage ventures, from founders with ideas to seed rounds. It signs equity checks up to $250,000. In addition to equity checks, Founders Factory Africa invests $100K to $300K in non-dilutive funds in its portfolio companies. The VC firm says it collaborates with startups in the fintech and healthtech industries. Since its launch, Founders Factory Africa has funded over 55 African tech startups, including Zuri Health, OkHi, and MyCover.AI. But it also points out that the company's founders have developed solutions in edtech, agritech, logistics, and other fields by using its proprietary technology to address problems in several industries. Moreover, Founders Factory Africa plans to intensify efforts to address the gender imbalance in the ecosystem. A BCG report shows that women-led businesses ultimately generate a higher revenue than those founded by men, making the underfunding of these businesses a troubling issue. But in 2022, male-led startups received a disproportionate 96% ($4.6bn) of the total volume, leaving female-led businesses on the continent with a meagre 4% ($188m). Moreover, the VC firm wants to reach more African tech startups by expanding its investment model. It also intends to broaden the types of capital investments it provides, including non-dilutive capital, to meet the continent's demand for various capital deployment strategies along the venture maturity curve.
MTN South Africa to pay R1.9 billion The International Finance Corporation (IFC) became a minority shareholder in Safaricom Ethiopia in June 2023. It made a $157.4 million equity investment in the telco's parent consortium, The Global Partnership for Ethiopia. It also gave a $100 million loan to the telecom company. Consequently, Safaricom's ownership in the Ethiopian subsidiary will decline to 51.7%, retaining control of the joint venture. Vodacom’s stake will also decrease from 6.2 per cent to 5.7 per cent. Sumitomo Corporation, which currently owns a 27.2 per cent stake in Safaricom Ethiopia, and British International Investment (10.9 per cent) are two additional investors that will also see their stakes reduced. Here's what I've got for you today: MTN South Africa to pay R1.9 billion before H2 2023 Kenyans can now hold more money in their M-Pesa accounts d.light's $30m securitisation facility MTN South Africa to pay R1.9 billion before the end of H2 2023 In its half-year financial performance, MTN Group disclosed that Mastercard will acquire a minority stake in its fintech business, MoMo. MTN has not specified the size of its stake, but it said that once the companies complete due diligence, they will sign the investment agreements. In additional MTN news, the MTN Group announced that its South African subsidiary would shortly pay the communications authority, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), the outstanding amount of R1.9 billion for the spectrum it bought but couldn’t use. MTN South Africa and a few other mobile operators, including Vodacom and Telkom, purchased frequencies in the “digital dividend” bands in the 2022 spectrum auction. MTN purchased 100 MHz in the spectrum auction: 40 MHz in the 2.6 GHz band, 40 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band, and 20 MHz in the 800 MHz. Consequently, MTN South Africa said it would pay in the second half of 2023 to deploy more spectrum across the country. Kenyans can now hold more money in their M-PESA accounts Starting today, August 15, 2023, M-PESA customers get increased transaction limits. This announcement is due to a revised mobile money transaction cap by the Central Bank of Kenya. It allows an increase in account and daily transaction limits to KSh 500,000 for all customers. Safaricom CEO, Peter Ndegwa, says the increase in account limits is consistent with the company’s commitment to offering customers simple and reliable mobile money services. He also states that as the share of cashless transactions keeps increasing, the higher account limits will offer customers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), greater convenience. Why is this important? One survey shows that about 9 in 10 SMEs use M-PESA. Besides, during the previous fiscal year, from March 2022 to March 2023, Lipa Na M-PESA processed KSh 1.625 trillion in transactions for more than 606,000 businesses. In 2020, M-PESA launched several products and services, including the M-Pesa business app, USSD codes for merchants, and micro SME wallet, to empower and assist SMEs grow. What’s more, M-PESA customers will benefit from an increase in the daily transaction limit from KSh 300,000 to KSh 500,000. Although Kenyans can now transact up to KSh 500,000 per day, the telco mentioned that the current per-transaction cap of KSh 150,000 would remain in place. d.light's $30m securitisation facility Kenyan-based solar solutions company, d.light, has secured a $30 million securitisation facility from the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank Group (TDB Group). The company can purchase up to $125 million in receivable assets. What is a securitisation facility? It is a financial arrangement that allows a company to raise capital by selling assets to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which then issues securities backed by those assets. After that, investors buy the securities and receive the principal and interest payments of the underlying assets. The company can use the funds raised from the sale of its assets to finance new projects or pay off existing debt. In this case, d.light will use the funds to increase the number of low-income individuals and households that can buy its solar-powered household goods in Tanzania. Currently led by CEO, Nick Imudia, D.light was founded in 2007 by Sam Goldman and Ned Tozun. The company provides products to low-income families and has sold close to 30 million products, including solar lanterns, solar home systems, TVs, radios, and smartphones.

Mastercard to acquire a slice of MTN's $5.2 billion fintech unit Payments giant, Mastercard, has agreed to buy a minority stake in MoMo, MTN's $5.2 billion fintech division. MTN Group revealed this in a half-year financial performance statement issued on Monday. MTN CEO, Ralph Mupita, stated that the transaction will be divided into two parts: a commercial agreement on payments and remittances that will use Mastercard's technology infrastructure to expand in Africa and an investment in a minority stake. This move comes after Mastercard invested $100 million in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV, the holding company for the mobile money operations of Airtel Africa, in 2021. Similar to what it will do with MTN, Mastercard used the investment to purchase a minority stake in the telecom's fintech division. While MTN has not disclosed the size of its stake, it has stated that investment agreements will be signed as soon as due diligence is completed. Our grand plan to unlock riches from Nigeria's hidden wealth - MoMo PSB CEO, Eli Hini MTN said it realised the fintech company's rapid expansion plans in the first half of this year. It also stated that 61 million active MoMo customers executed the 8.3 billion transactions, which saw a 37% increase in volume. Meanwhile, in August 2023, Airtel Africa and Mastercard partnered to launch a new cross-border remittance service that will make it simple for its 100 million customers in 14 African countries to send and receive money across borders.
Uber denies drivers' involvement in attacks I hope you are as eager to start the new week as I am. Yeah, I know: I dislike Mondays. But I had a fun weekend thanks to a friend and Digest reader who saw my request to escape from home and decided to grant it. Besides, I am looking forward to the week and hoping to avoid Snickers and Maryland cookies, even though I am on my second chocolate bar as I write this. I am reporting myself so you can hold me accountable by Friday. I’ve got some news: The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) plans to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) developers’ communities across Nigeria to shape the future of technology in the country. Kashifu Inuwa, the Director-General of NITDA, stated that they would begin in three states in 2023 and then strategise on expanding it to other states and, eventually, local government areas. Here's what I've got for you today: Uber says drivers are not responsible for attacks on riders Malawi plans to connect almost 8K public schools to the Internet Uber says drivers are not responsible for attacks on riders in South Africa Last Sunday, the Sunday Times reported that four people in Pretoria, South Africa, accused some Uber drivers of robbery and assault. It followed complaints from several Facebook users who said that alleged Uber drivers had attacked them. Between then and now, the number of cases reported increased by three more people to seven. So, what’s Uber saying? The ride-hailing company said drivers on its platform were not responsible for the recent attacks on riders. It stated that passengers who got into the wrong cars were more likely to be blamed. Uber's General Manager for sub-Saharan Africa, Kagiso Khaole, urged passengers to double-check their driver and vehicle information before getting into a car. He also said riders can enable PIN verification, which is necessary for a trip to begin. Khaole stated that the company investigated the situation by gathering statements from drivers and analysing allegations using its technology, among other things. However, one of the victims, Kayleigh Marx, who Uber reportedly denied her allegations, stated that simply verifying the licence plate and ensuring the PIN was insufficient. She urged riders to check the drivers’ boots and ensure the child lock is not on and Uber drivers take the correct route. Sidebar Alert: Following altercations between ride-hailing drivers and minibus taxi owners, the Soweto United E-hailing Association and the Soweto Taxi Association banned Uber and Bolt drivers from picking up or dropping off passengers at any malls in the South African town on June 7, 2023. Malawi plans to connect almost 8K public schools to the Internet The Malawian government intends to provide Internet access to 7,962 public schools through the Connect a School Project. Formerly known as the Connect a Constituency Project, the government implemented it to bridge the digital divide over the last eight years. Nevertheless, it faced several challenges, such as the suitability of the telecentres' locations, high construction costs, and rising material and equipment costs. Because of these difficulties, the project had less value in terms of long-term societal and economic advancement. Moses Kunkuyu, the Minister of Information and Digitalisation, explained that the Connect a School Project is a turnaround strategy that will use existing infrastructure (schools) to connect students and community members to the Internet. Why? Kunkuyu said connecting schools has many benefits, including access to an expanding library of educational materials, online education, and cost savings due to the automation of labour-intensive tasks and reducing textbook printing and distribution costs. Also, 4.03 million people in Malawi — 20.2% of the country's total population — used the Internet in January 2022. Thus, Kunkuya says focusing on schools and the neighbourhoods around them is a potentially effective way to bring excluded communities into the digital economy.

Solana, Litecoin, and Pomerdoge - 3 Reasons Why Analysts Are Bullish Get the scoop on three reasons analysts are bullish on cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Litecoin, and Pomerdoge. Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Pomerdoge (POMD) - these digital assets have captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. In this article, we'll delve into all three of them and explore why analysts express bullish sentiments about their potential. Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Solana (SOL): Unveiling the Future of DeFi Solana (SOL) has gained attention due to its impressive scalability and lightning-fast transaction speeds. As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector flourishes, Solana's ability to handle high transaction volumes with minimal fees has positioned it as a top contender. In recent Solana news, data from Messari showed that it experienced a TVL gain of 14% over the previous month, while other top chains had a loss. As a result, Solana surpasses Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain in TVL while sustaining a six-month streak of uninterrupted uptime of 100%. Consequently, the Solana price increased by 6.9% in the past week alone. Solana trades hands at $24.27 with a market cap of $9.8B. Moreover, the moving averages for it are showing strong buy signals. Thus, experts forecast a $29.22 price point for Solana by December 2023. Litecoin (LTC): An Increase in Inflows Litecoin (LTC) has been a staple in the cryptocurrency market. While some argue it has taken a backseat to newer projects, analysts see Litecoin's resilience as a valuable asset. According to CoinShares, investors recently chose funds focused on XRP, Litecoin, and Solana instead of Bitcoin. Thus, Litecoin saw $0.46M in inflows. Also, interest in it jumped as the third Litecoin halving event was recently performed. Currently, the Litecoin price sits at $83.90 with a market cap of $6.1B. Experts claim that Litecoin's established reputation could increase interest and adoption, increasing its value. Therefore, they predict a rise to $105.02 for Litecoin by the end of 2023. Pomerdoge (POMD): Combining Blockchain Technology and Gaming Since Q1 2022, the blockchain gaming market has increased by 2000%, and Pomerdoge (POMD) aims to capitalize on it. This groundbreaking Play-to-Earn (P2E) game promises thrilling gameplay and unique opportunities for significant gains. We will shortly be showing you what the pomerplace looks like! This is a marketplace and arena where you can battle one and other in a winner takes all situation for your pomerdoge! Collect and purchase skins, items and give your pomerdoge better attributes to be the king. The Pomergame Phenomenon Pomerdoge has captured the attention of both gaming enthusiasts and crypto investors with its upcoming crypto P2E game - Pomergame. At its core, Pomergame offers players an immersive gaming experience where they can build and level up their characters, engage in battles, and more. One of the standout features of Pomerdoge is the Pomerplace marketplace. Players can buy, sell, and trade in-game items and skins using POMD native tokens. Players can showcase their creativity by designing custom items and avatars, enhancing the gaming experience. Moreover, security is another point of focus for the Pomerdoge team. In fact, it has already stated that it will lock liquidity forever while freezing team tokens for two years. Additionally, Pomerdoge has already obtained two audits by Cyberscope and SolidProof - both finding it 100% safe. NFTs and Beyond Countless individuals are drawn to the Pomerdoge project thanks to its unique 7,777 NFT collection scheduled for launch in August / September. Each of these NFTs will be worth 0.2 ETH and provide holders with exclusive perks. But, gaining access to this collection is only done by owning the POMD token.

From ProductDive to uniting product leaders at The Dive 2023 conference: How Tobi Otokiti is empowering present and future product managers Raised in the ancient city of Ibadan, Tobi Otokiti is a global product management leader who continues to build products in the African tech industry. Called Tobillions by her colleagues, thanks to her impressive record of working at companies that became unicorns, she has also made a name for herself as an educator in the tech space. Tobi is the founder of one of the leading product management schools in the West African region, ProductDive. In our interview, she discussed her background, faith, path to becoming a product manager, ProductDive, and the upcoming product leadership conference, The Dive 2023. The Dive 2023 conference is a product-focused conference bringing global product leaders, product managers, business leaders, and other tech professionals under one roof to take a deep dive into the world of product management and how to make lasting impacts in their organisations. Here’s an abridged version of the interview. Tell us a bit about yourself I consider myself a female technologist. I am a product management leader who has built products in the African tech industry for about ten years. I have worked at three unicorns—Interswitch, Andela, and Flutterwave—helping to build their various products which are being used by over five million users. In fact, combined, there are more than 50 million users who have experienced and used products that I've worked on. For example, I have a product that's used by all banks in Nigeria. I've worked on B2C and B2B products — products that interface with individuals and products that interface with businesses. I would also say that I'm an entrepreneur. I always look at things from the point of view of problem-solving. Beyond my professional work, I have a series of social impact projects that I do with youth. I have a lovely husband. You know, I am a career-focused person, but it's the same intentionality that I give to my career and the same intentionality that I give to my family, like being present for my children. I believe it's the lessons that you learn from age one to ten that you, in a way, apply to life. And if a parent is missing from that part of a child's life, that might negatively impact the child. It's about being present, available, and intentional about my family and about grooming them. In terms of educational background, I have bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science. And I'm a Christian; I believe in God a lot. I think that most of where I am right now is a combination of my work and God's grace and favour. So, I cannot leave out that part of the God factor in my life. Journey to product management When I completed my computer science degree in Ibadan, I was still very unsure of what to do because what they teach most of the time in computer science is programming. There has to be something programming-related that you need to do, and I do not enjoy programming. I later figured out why I did not enjoy programming. I did a personality test to also be more self-aware, to know who I am and the kinds of things that I would enjoy. I'm not someone who would like to sit down and code. I would rather talk to someone or interface with customers. I would love to solve your problem, but in order to do so, I must first understand the problems you are experiencing. This means I need to talk to you. A lot of people feel product management is about building tech apps. It's not. Product management is about solving problems. And that's why I think that I have remained in this industry and why I'm thriving, because right now it looks like I'm playing to my strengths as opposed to if I were a programmer. I got into product management in 2015, and my journey with product management started at Interswitch. Before then, I had tried many things, including laptop repairs; I even took certification courses in ORACLE and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), and this was me trying to test many waters. At the start of my career, there was a lot of trying things out to be sure of what I wanted to do, and while doing that, I made sure to reach out to people that were working in the industry. I would always share my CV with them and also inform them of the certification I had just taken. Also, they knew that I was preparing myself for what would be useful in these organisations. To be honest, when I was doing my research, I saw Interswitch as a very big company, so I didn’t see myself working there. When Interswitch sent me an email, I was shocked that a big company could call me for an interview. I think another thing that I did well then was adding everything that I had done to my CV and sharing it with people to help me review it. Before Interswitch, I built a library during my NYSC; I added it to my CV. I also talked about the work that I was doing in my church. I had held some positions of leadership in the church, and I was not afraid to talk about them during the interview. While I had not done those things in a corporate organisation, those were skill sets that I had already expressed in one way or another. Eventually, when I got the job, I asked my hiring manager why they took me while knowing that I didn’t really have much professional work experience. She said that during the interview, I showed that I was ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work. In the first promotional circle that they had in the organisation when I joined, I was promoted. When I joined Andela, my manager said one of the reasons they chose me was my honesty, and that’s what I want people to be: honest and authentic. So, I got into my first product management job by being authentic and talking about the things that I had done in the past, even though I didn’t have product management experience before, and from all of that, they could deduce that this lady would be a good project manager. The decision to remain in product management When I built products and saw reviews about them, I was happy. I felt the same way when I saw people using the library I built. I am truly solving people's problems, which has always been my core. My core concern has always been how to make people happy, which has earned me the name happiness minister. I’ve stayed longer in product management because of the satisfaction of truly solving problems and the opportunity to speak with real users, which programming wasn’t giving me. With programming, I was doing lots of interaction with my laptop, while with product management, I am dealing with lives, and I see the result. How did ProductDive start, and how has the journey been so far? When I started my product management journey, we didn’t have product schools and product management communities like we do now. Roughly ten years ago, in Africa, you would not have seen product managers with the product manager title. When I joined Interswitch, my job title was product consultant, but it was a product management role. The job title was confusing, and I always went online to search for what the role of a product consultant entails. When I had conversations with people in the same role, it was as if everyone had the same problem; we were all trying to figure things out. I started searching online for product schools, and then I found Product School Silicon Valley, and I also discovered that they were looking for community organisers. I signed up for the community organiser role and became their first community organiser in Nigeria. I hosted local events for them in Nigeria and ensured that people had an amazing experience, and I was funding these hangouts from my purse. Later, I reached out to Product School, requesting that they make their course accessible and affordable to people in this part of the world, and they said that their target wasn't Nigeria at that time. So, I said that’s fine; at least I have been doing product management for some years, so it’s time to do something for my fellow Nigerians. That was when I said, "I don’t know everything, and I don’t have to be the one teaching everything." I decided that I was going to start ProductDive, and it’s going to be a deep dive into the work. Also, in teaching, I am now using African examples; nobody is giving me Silicon Valley examples that I cannot really relate to. ProductDive started in September 2019, and it's driven by experience and giving people a total experience. Even the instructors are experienced professionals because I want to take people from one level to another. We started with one course, and now we have two courses because there’s a lot to learn about product management. I started teaching product management because I had a challenge, and there are many other people who have this challenge. At ProductDive, we are all about quality over quantity. We equip people with the right tools, knowledge, and community. This is because you need a community, and that's what makes ProductDive different from other Product Schools. You can't be in training everyday of the year, but you can be in a community that you can reach out to at any point, and you are assured that somebody will help you. All ProductDive members have lifetime access to the community. So ProductDive, in summary, is training, elevating your skillset, and everything needed to help you gain promotion at work, to help you get a new job, and to connect you with people. It is also the community and this conference, The Dive 2023, where product leaders will be coming around. So far, we've trained over 1,500 people. I am proud to say that almost every startup in Nigeria has a ProductDive alumnus. What should people expect at The DIVE 2023 conference Quality content and industry-specific information. Product management varies in different industries such as e-commerce, retail, and fintech, and we're going to do a deep dive into these industries because having product management knowledge is not enough to succeed as a product leader. You need an understanding of your market (the people you are selling to and their buying capacity), where you are playing, the regulators, the risks, the stakeholders, and the investors. Another thing is the calibre of people that we are exposing you to. So there will be high-level networking with global product leaders. For organisations looking for quality talent and those offering products used by product managers and tools requiring integration with their products, this event presents a chance to introduce and promote their offerings. There will also be workshops where we will teach product processes and governance. You don't get the results you want when you don't have processes and structures in your business. There's no amount of dreaming that you can do, you will still fall to the level of your structure. So if you want to learn how to craft the right product processes that support your product goals and your business goals, have to be there. We will also be teaching product strategy because you are in trouble if you do not have a strategy; you'll probably run out of business and fold up. There’s also the aspect of product delivery and the product road map. All these will be discussed at the conference, and that's the experience that we are preparing for all attendees. If you have yet to register for The Dive 2023 product leadership conference, head over to the ProductDive website and secure your slot.

Anyway, if you have an event or a hangout on Saturday or Sunday in Lagos, please, send an invite. One last thing before we move to the gist for the day: On this week’s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discussed several stories, including X paying creators on the platform, Eritrea's first PC video game, and Sendy ceasing operations. Watch or listen here. Here's what I've got for you today: Airtel Uganda plans to go public NITDA wants to verify NYSC certificates on the blockchain South Africa launches a platform to improve health Airtel Uganda plans to go public Airtel Uganda plans to sell its shares to the general public on the Uganda Securities Exchange. Airtel Africa intends to float 8 billion ordinary shares, or 20% of its equity, on the Main Investment Market Segment. Why? Airtel Africa said the main goal of the IPO is to support the growth of the capital market in Uganda and promote local ownership of Airtel Uganda. This move adheres to the National Telecom Operator (NTO) licence requirement that Airtel Uganda list at least 20% of its shares. Airtel received a one-year extension after its inability to list its shares by December last year. So, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) gave a deadline of December 16, 2023, to fulfill the requirement. Airtel Uganda will sell common shares as part of the IPO and receive the net proceeds of the offering after deducting costs. The shares will be made available through the platform of Airtel Money and conventional channels, increasing retail participation, with special preference given to Ugandan investors. NITDA wants to verify NYSC certificates on the blockchain The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) plans to use blockchain technology to verify National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) certificates. On Wednesday, August 9, 2023, Yusuf Kashafu, Director-General of NITDA, disclosed this while expressing concern about the widespread forgery and fraudulent issuance of NYSC certificates. Consequently, NITDA is working with the NYSC Director General, Brigadier-General Yusha'u Ahmed, to develop a blockchain-based certificate authentication system. However, this is not a new phenomenon. There are startups in Nigeria using blockchain technology to verify certificates. Akowe, for example, is using blockchain technology to digitise certificate issuance and verification. Bolu covered the startup. You can revisit it here: Akowe wants to put Nigerian certificates on the blockchain, and here's how it will work In addition, I recently published an article about how some African healthtech startups are using blockchain to combat counterfeit drugs. You can read it here: African healthtech startups are combating counterfeit drugs with blockchain, AI South Africa launches platform to improve health Did you know that, as of 2020, Southern Africa had the highest rate of HIV infections in Africa? Unfortunately, South Africa had the highest prevalence of the disease on the continent, with 7.8 million people living with HIV in 2020. Additionally, just like in most African nations, there are scarce resources on mental health, and mental illness is stigmatised. Consequently, South Africa’s Department of Health (DOH) has launched a WhatsApp-based chatbot, Young Africa Live (YAL), to address these challenges and improve the health of young people. The DOH collaborated with the Elton John AIDS Foundation and Reach Digital Health (formerly Praekelt.org) to help young people in South Africa address the complex questions that arise during adolescence. These include love and relationships, sexuality, mental health, HIV and STIs, contraception and pregnancy. You might be wondering why the DOH launched a WhatsApp chatbot. Well, it’s simple: WhatsApp has more than 23 million users in South Africa, surpassing other messaging services like Signal and Telegram. Sidebar Alert: In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a WhatsApp platform developed by Reach Digital Health, to disseminate information about the coronavirus outbreak.

Moove raises $76 million in new funding to support global expansion Nigerian-born mobility fintech company, Moove, has raised $76 million in new funding to build the largest tech-driven financial services platform for mobility entrepreneurs. The financing consists of $28 million in equity, $10 million in venture debt from funds and accounts, and $38 million in previously undisclosed funds raised over the past year. BlackRock manages the venture debt, while Mubadala Investment Company led the equity round, which included new and existing investors. The funding marks the beginning of a partnership in which Faris Sohail Al Mazrui, Head of Ventures & Growth at Mubadala, will join the advisory board of Moove. Launched in 2020 to assist African mobility entrepreneurs in obtaining vehicle financing, Moove plans to further its global reach by launching several new products. The startup, which plans to achieve profitability by the end of the current fiscal year, will speed up its product development and continue to invest in improving the customer experience. It will also focus even more on its lucrative markets, such as the United Arab Emirates, India, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. In July 2023, the mobility fintech announced its $8 million funding from Absa Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) to significantly expand its existing fleet of Suzuki S-Presso vehicles assembled in Ghana. After raising over $140 million in four funding rounds, the mobility startup announced in December 2022 that it had laid off its employees. A few days later, the company secured an additional $30 million in December 2022, bringing the total amount raised to $181.8 million.
Safaricom Ethiopia suspends operations in the country’s second-largest region Safaricom Ethiopia has shut down its sites in Amhara, the country's second-largest region. This move comes after the federal government declared a six-month state of emergency in the area on August 4, 2023, due to a crisis between the military and the Fano militia, a part-time militia with no formal command structure. For context, Fano supported federal forces during the two-year civil war in the neighbouring Tigray region, which ended last November with a truce. However, the alleged disregard by the national government for Amhara's security by some in the area has strained relations. Conflict reportedly broke out between the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) and the Amhara militia Fano on August 1, 2023, in several Amhara Region locations, beginning in Kobo and Debre Tabor. The following day, Fano took control of Lalibela Airport. Consequently, the government declared the region a state of emergency two days later. And now, millions of people in the Amhara region can no longer use Safaricom's services. The shutdown's impact on Safaricom Ethiopia's 1,272 sites hasn’t yet been made public. But Safaricom Ethiopia chairman, Michael Joseph, said the closure halted the company's momentum for growth in the vast nation. In light of recent events, Joseph stated that the country was a competitive market and that its stability took precedence over all other interests because an unstable environment can make it challenging to work effectively. By the end of 2024, Safaricom hopes to have 3,000 network sites in Ethiopia. With 397 collocated sites, Safaricom Ethiopia had 875 own-built network sites that covered 22 cities across the nation. Besides, the telco had 2.1 million 90-day active customers, with 10 million being the goal for 2024. Nonetheless, Safaricom Ethiopia’s plans to introduce its mobile money service in the nation before the end of the year are still on track.
Airtel Africa partners Mastercard to launch a new cross-border remittance service Spotify has expanded its AI-powered “DJ” into 50 countries, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, and Kenya. This feature is accessible via your mobile app’s "music" feed section. Like a radio DJ who tailors their show to every individual, the AI-enabled DJ customises your listening experience through a carefully chosen music library and spoken-word commentary driven by a synthetic voice. The commentary features light-hearted banter and contextual information that alludes to particular songs and artists the user has previously listened to. The DJ is coming six months after debuting in North America. Here's what I've got for you today: Bye to DStv in Malawi Airtel Africa partners Mastercard Knife Capital completes the final close of its $50m third fund Bye to DStv in Malawi Do you still watch DStv? I think senior citizens watch TV or DStv the most. I could be wrong, though. I live with a 20-something-year-old who's a religious DStv customer. So, what do you think? Should Intelpoint do a survey? Intelpoint, does this interest you? If you did not know, Intelpoint is Techpoint Africa's research arm. Interestingly, it is hosting the Nigerian Fintech Executive Mixer on Thursday, August 17, 2023, in Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. It’s a must for you if you’re a stakeholder in Nigeria's fintech space. Register here to attend. That’s by the way. Let’s get to the news: Satellite TV provider, MultiChoice, has discontinued DStv service in Malawi on Monday, August 8, 2023. Why? MultiChoice Malawi (MCM) announced plans to increase DStv rates in the country. However, due to an interim injunction issued by the High Court at the end of July 2023, the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) blocked it. Essentially, the injunction prevented MCM from increasing the DSTV tariffs. That still does not explain why, right? Here it is: The basis of the injunction was the argument that MultiChoice Africa was ineligible to determine or change DStv service rates in the country because it did not directly offer the service to the general public. In light of this, MultiChoice ended operations in Malawi due to unfavourable regulatory conditions and the penalties for non-compliance, which included staff imprisonment. So, if you live in Malawi or know a resident who enjoys watching DStv, tell them to stop paying for the service. But if they've paid for their most recent subscription, they can use the service until the current 30-day viewing cycle expires on or before September 10, 2023. Airtel Africa partners Mastercard to launch a new cross-border remittance service Airtel Africa and Mastercard have partnered to roll out a new cross-border remittance service that will make it simple for its 100 million customers in 14 African countries to send and receive money across borders. These countries are Chad, Congo Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The platform will link customers to wallets in over 145 markets through prompt delivery, secure transfers, and affordable transaction costs. This isn't the first time Mastercard would be partnering with Airtel. Following the payments giants' $100 million investment in Airtel Africa's mobile money business, Airtel Money, in April 2021, Mastercard and Airtel Money Zambia launched a new digital payment option for customers with or without a bank account. The partnership gave Airtel Money Zambia users access to Mastercard's worldwide network of merchants and a global online marketplace for several digital payments. Sidebar Alert: In May 2023, Britam Insurance partnered with Airtel Money and Inclusivity Solutions, a digital insurance solutions company, to offer affordable mobile-enabled insurance coverage in Kenya. The insurance programme, known as Limodzi Insurance, protects lower-income families against several risks, including the loss of income experienced by small business owners, independent contractors, or people and their families who are hospitalised or injured in accidents. Knife Capital completes the final close of its $50m third fund South African growth-stage investor, Knife Capital, has completed the final close of its $50 million third fund, Knife Capital III. Knife Capital intends to focus on South African entrepreneurs with strong exit potential in the Series B stage and co-invest in businesses from other African countries with local investors. Several investors, including the VC team, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Mineworkers Investment Company (MIC), Standard Bank, Skybound Capital, and Fireball Capital, committed to Knife Fund III. Since 2010 — the year the VC was founded — progress has been gradual and steady. The $10 million first fund, known as Knife Capital Fund I or HBD Venture Capital, gave startups seed money. With Knife Capital Fund II, the VC firm launched its 12J offering in 2016. The $25 million fund (KNF Ventures), still ongoing, invests primarily in the Series A stage. With seven exits between the two funds, including notable ones like Visa's $110M acquisition of fintech startup Fundamo and orderTalk's acquisition by UberEats, Knife Capital hopes to repeat this success with its third fund as it assists in its global expansion.

Airtel Kenya plans to invest over $150 million to expand network coverage Airtel Kenya plans to invest more than $150 million (KSh21.5 billion) over the next three years to expand its network coverage. It wants to accomplish this through several initiatives, including adding 649 new network sites across Kenya. The telco’s CEO, Ashish Malhotra, said Airtel Kenya is considering opening at least one service shop in each ward to increase brand visibility. He noted that only 250 wards had not yet received coverage, a gap that will be closed over the next three months. Malhotra added that the telco requires $150 million in additional investments over the following two to three years, just from a network perspective. It will also invest in other things, such as bringing more reasonably priced routers. Since its launch in Kenya, the telco has invested more than $1 billion (KSh143.3 billion) in the country, with the majority of that investment occurring in the last three years. Additionally, in June 2023, Airtel Kenya announced plans to add 349 new sites to expand its network's coverage by the end of the year and meet the nation's increasing demand for data services. The company's network infrastructure spans over 3200 sites and extends across all 47 counties or 89% of the country. In July 2023, the telco launched its 5G network following months of testing.
MultiChoice pulls the plug on DStv service in Malawi after government bars price hikes Satellite TV provider, MultiChoice, will no longer accept new DStv subscriptions or reconnections in Malawi starting Wednesday, August 9, 2023, because it no longer provides the DStv service in the country. This move comes after MultiChoice Malawi announced plans to raise DStv rates in the Southeastern African country. However, the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) barred the DStv tariff adjustment following an interim injunction from the nation's High Court at the end of July 2023. The injunction prevented Multichoice Malawi (MCM) from increasing the DSTV tariffs. Following the high court’s second order, Multichoice terminated its DStv service in Malawi yesterday, August 8, 2023. The basis for MACRA's injunction was the argument that Multichoice Africa was ineligible to set or modify DStv service tariffs in the nation because it did not directly provide the service to the general public. MultiChoice Africa has no choice but to permanently discontinue the DStv service due to the regulatory landscape that makes it difficult to operate and the consequences of non-compliance, which included imprisonment for the company's staff. MultiChoice urged Malawians to stop paying for DStv services. Users who have already paid for their most recent subscription may continue to use the service until the current 30-day viewing cycle expires on or before September 10, 2023. Meanwhile, in 2023, MultiChoice increased its DStv rates in some African countries, including South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. For instance, in July 2023, the company announced that it’d raise the prices of all its DStv and GOtv packages in Kenya due to the country’s rising inflation and currency depreciation, starting August 1, 2023. Besides, in April 2023, MultiChoice Nigeria increased the prices of DStv and GOtv packages due to the country’s rising inflation.
Sendy is reportedly ceasing operations and considering a sale of its assets Kenyan logistics startup, Sendy, is reportedly ceasing operations and considering selling its assets. The company has yet to reveal many details about this transaction, including which company will acquire it, for how much, and whether the new owners will reduce its workforce further or keep it at its current size. However, the business confirmed to TechCrunch that an acquisition process is currently underway. “We are in the middle of an acquisition process. So yes, Sendy is being acquired. We will issue a formal joint statement in two weeks or so time. In the meantime, we are unable to comment on further details at this time.” The company reportedly ran out of funds two months ago and has been struggling to cut costs since 2022 to stay afloat. In 2022, Sendy planned to raise $100 million but only received a small portion of the funding from MOL PLUS, the corporate venture capital of a Japanese transportation company, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. Consequently, Sendy has reportedly been looking into additional options to support its business, including finding new funding and a buyer. In 2022, Sendy was negotiating to receive additional funding from several investors. However, one of its major investors pulled out of the deal. This move left the business without funds for several months, including money to pay salaries. Launched in 2015 by Meshack Alloys, Evanson Biwott, Don Okoth, and Malaika Judd, Sendy provides eCommerce, enterprise, and freight delivery services for a client list that includes Unilever, DHL, Maersk, Safaricom, and African online retailer Jumia. The company connects customers and businesses with delivery drivers who deliver packages and goods across several locations using motorcycles, tuk-tuks, and vans. Since its launch, Sendy has received disclosed funding totalling $26.5 million from several investors, including Toyota Tsusho, Atlantica Ventures, VestedWorld, Keppel Capital, Enza Capital, AAICA Investment Pte Ltd, Sunu Capital, and Goodwill Investments. Meanwhile, in July 2022, Sendy laid off 10% of its 300-person team, citing "current realities impacting tech companies globally." But ever since, the logistics business has cut back on staff through additional cost-cutting measures. In October, the company terminated its Supply service and reduced its workforce by 10%. In February 2023, Sendy also suspended its on-the-ground operations — an end-to-end fulfilment offering — in Nigeria to "find the right product for the market."
Booking rides ahead in Kenya You must have enjoyed Bolu's newsletters. I told you, he's fun. Now that I'm back, I'm sure you will miss him. I liked his newsletter headlines. He's quite skilled at creating catchy headlines. Did you read his letters? Visit this link, and let me know if the first three headlines don't catch your attention. Well, did you miss me? My break was pleasant. I'd update you later on how that went, but first, I have juicy gist for you. Here it is: Techpoint Africa's research arm, Intelpoint, is inviting stakeholders in Nigeria's fintech space to the Nigerian Fintech Executive Mixer happening on Thursday, August 17, 2023, in Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. Register here to attend. Here's what I've got for you today: South African competition regulator recommends blocking Vodacom-Maziv deal Fixing Internet connectivity in South Africa Kenyans can now book their rides in advance South African competition regulator recommends blocking Vodacom-Maziv deal The Competition Commission has advised against approving Vodacom's purchase of a stake in fibre operator, Maziv. Why? The proposed transaction will likely reduce or eliminate competition in several markets. The Commission also says most market participants have expressed opposition to the merger following its thorough investigation and consultation with them, which included mobile network operators (MNOs), fibre network operators, and Internet service providers. However, Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) and Maziv have responded to the Commission's recommendation. Note: Maziv is the parent company for CIVH’s two fibre network assets, Vumatel and DFA. CIVH claims the Commission's recommendation does not mark the end of the process. So, the parties will now approach the Competition Tribunal to present information and make their case for the merger's approval. When did it start? At the end of 2021, the companies submitted their R13.2-billion deal to the regulator. Fun facts: Although it usually takes 12 to 18 months to complete these transactions, the deal has been on the Commission's desk for 20 months. In 2022, the industry regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), gave its conditional approval. Fixing Internet connectivity in South Africa On Sunday, a rock fell in the Congo Canyon, causing two undersea cables in South African — the West African Cable System (WACS) and the South Atlantic 3 (SAT-3) — to break. For context, SAT-3 was cut on Sunday morning, while WACS went down in the evening. They are deployed in the Atlantic Ocean, connecting South Africa and many other African countries to Europe. The breaks occurred between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon using the Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometer employed by the systems to measure distance. This break indicates one thing: slow Internet connectivity. However, local fibre providers, including Openserve and Broadband Infraco, are working to fix service interruptions for Internet connectivity. For instance, Openserve claimed the break affects only international private leased circuit services users on its network. It also said its investment in additional cable capacities will allow customers to continue to enjoy uninterrupted Interɗnet connectivity. However, on the social networking platform, Discord, users cannot launch voice servers hosted in South Africa. The break in the WASC cable has disrupted the backbone link of the social networking app’s service provider, Ubisoft-owned i3D.net. Is there any hope of resolving the issue? There is, but it could take a month or more for a cable repair ship to reach where the WACS broke. Kenyans can now book their rides in advance You can now reserve a ride in advance on the ride-hailing app, Bolt, if you are in Nairobi, Kenya. With the help of the new Scheduled Ride feature, Kenyans can now schedule their rides up to 72 hours in advance, giving drivers enough time to prepare. Why should you care? Finding a ride during rush hour will be less of a concern if you book in advance. But there is a catch: Using the service comes with an additional cost. How do you book a ride in advance? Open the Bolt app, then tap the icon that looks like a car and a calendar. Add the ride date and time, specify the destination, pick a ride category, and tap Reserve Bolt to confirm your request. This service is also available in Nigeria. I noticed it on the Bolt app on Sunday, August 6, 2023. Nigerians can book in advance from 15 minutes to 30 days. The Scheduled Ride feature, which first became available in May 2023, isn’t exclusive to Bolt. Some ride-hailing companies in Africa, including Uber, Lyft, and Lagos Ride, allow customers to book their rides in advance In case you missed it Nigerian influencer shares how he made ₦220k from X (formerly Twitter) Grinta makes its third acquisition in three years as it snaps up Auto Cure Talents Arena raises $750,000 pre-seed round to drive Middle East and North Africa expansion Safaricom Ethiopia to receive $257.4 million from the World Bank Group to increase mobile connectivity What I'm reading and watching Google launches Project IDX, a new AI-enabled browser-based development environment How HIV First Started in Humans Man Dies, Discovers Ultimate Truth About Our Soul's Purpose on Earth, Consciousness & Oneness
Maziv responds to regulator’s recommendation to block the R13.2-billion Vodacom-Maziv merger South African Competition Commission's recommendation preventing Vodacom from acquiring a strategic stake in Maziv has prompted responses from Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) and Maziv. In 2022, Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) created Maziv by combining its fibre assets, Vumatel and Dark Fibre Africa (DFA), into one massive fibre infrastructure company. In a statement, CIVH and Maziv claim the Commission's recommendation does not mark the end of the merger process. Consequently, they will approach the Competition Tribunal to present information and make their case for the merger's approval. In the early hours of Tuesday, the Competition Commission advised against approving Vodacom's purchase of a stake in fibre operator Maziv. Although it usually takes 12 to 18 months to complete these transactions, it took the Commission 20 months to investigate and give feedback. The regulator says the proposed transaction would likely reduce or eliminate competition in several markets. It also says it may deny low-income consumers the benefits South Africa's wealthier and urban consumers enjoy from fixed competition's favourable effects on mobile products. The Commission states that most market participants have expressed opposition to the merger following its thorough investigation and consultation with them, which included mobile network operators (MNOs), fibre network operators, Internet service providers, and others. However, Maziv and CIVH, in a statement, say the investment will allow Maziv to add fibre infrastructure to an estimated 1 million additional homes in low-income areas, generate up to 10,000 new jobs, commit at least R10 billion to capital expenditures, and support the establishment of small to medium-sized businesses through a fund established specifically for this purpose with R300 million of committed capital. In 2021, the companies submitted their R13.2-billion deal to the regulator. It includes an R6 billion upfront cash payment, an R4.2 billion valuation of Vodacom's fibre assets, and an R3 billion secondary purchase. Vodacom would pay the money for up to a 40% stake in Maziv, co-controlling the business despite only owning a minor stake. Per the agreement, Vodacom and Community Investment Ventures Holdings (CIVH) would combine their networks to form a new company known as "Newco" or "Fibreco." But in 2022, CIVH revealed that the new business would be Maziv. Following that, in 2022, the industry regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), gave its conditional approval. Moreover, Maziv and CIVH say the deal will be advantageous for the market because it will make Vodacom fibre assets commercially available on an open-access, transparent, and non-discriminatory basis. The Commission's decision to block the deal is reportedly shocking to the local telecoms sector, which had expected a wave of consolidation. It also throws a major wrench in the plans of Remgro, the largest shareholder in CIVH, which saw the Vodacom transaction as a way to address the company's debt.

Grinta makes its third acquisition in three years as it snaps up Auto Cure Egyptian startup, Grinta, has announced the acquisition of Auto Cure for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition will help Grinta expand its footprints across Egypt, and is its third since it was founded in 2021. Previously, the startup had acquired PH Store, a B2B marketplace for pharmaceutical products, and EME, a software development company. Following the acquisition of Auto Cure, Mohamed Rezk, the startup’s co-founder and CEO, will join Grinta as a partner, leading its commercial team. However, it’s not yet clear what role, if any, Amr Kamel the other co-founder, will play. “Joining hands with Grinta is incredibly exciting for us; our commitment to digitizing the market and delivering customer satisfaction has led us to joining Grinta’s brilliant team. We have unlocked a world of possibilities, and together we will be extending our reach not only in Alexandria but throughout the Middle East and Africa,” Rezk said. In 2022, Grinta raised $8 million in seed funding, which it said would aid in developing its tech stack and accelerating expansion across Egypt. The startup, which works with more than 7,000 vendors, has delivered over 200,000 orders since 2021. Auto Cure, on the other hand, has worked with more than 450 pharmacies to deliver 5,000 orders since its inception. By joining forces, both companies can grab a larger share of Egypt’s healthtech market. In 2022, startups in the country’s healthcare sector raised $50.5 million, 6.2% of the total funding raised.
Talents Arena raises $750,000 pre-seed round to drive Middle East and North Africa expansion Egyptian recruitment startup, Talents Arena, has raised $750,000 in pre-seed funding from UI Investments. Several Saudi Arabian and Egyptian angel investors also joined the round. Talents Arena was founded in 2019 by Aya Elgebeely to ease the hiring process for organizations in the Middle East and North Africa. Since 2019, the startup has facilitated the placement of thousands of candidates in tech jobs. Some of the countries where its talents have been placed include Egypt, Tunisia, South Africa, Uganda, Germany, and the Netherlands. The startup has previously received $100,000 from Flat6Labs and NilePreneurs, and indicated interest in raising $2 million for expansion. According to Elgebeely who serves as the startup’s CEO, Talents Arena uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the hiring process. Its model helps both hiring managers and job seekers discover the best opportunities. Talents Arena makes money by charging subscription and commission fees, and as of 2020, it had made more than $65,000 in revenue. “This funding milestone enables us to accelerate the development of our AI hiring engine and expand our footprint in the Saudi market that already accounts for 25% of our client base. We are excited to bring our cutting-edge technology to businesses across industries in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, helping hiring managers and recruiters find talents faster with higher accuracy and at a better economical value,” she said.
Safaricom Ethiopia to receive $257.4 million from the World Bank Group to increase mobile connectivity Safaricom Ethiopia will receive $257.4 million (KSh36.8 billion) in funding from the World Bank Group to support the telco’s greenfield telecommunications projects. This move will increase Ethiopia’s mobile connectivity. The funding will come in equity investments, a loan, and guarantees through the World Bank Group’s private investment arm: International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Initially announced in June 2023, the IFC and the consortium finalised the agreement on August 7, 2023. The funding agreement calls for the IFC to lend the consortium $100 million (Sh14.3 billion) and to invest $157.4 million (KSh22.5 billion) in Global Partnership for Ethiopia BV (GPE) to support the greenfield projects. Consequently, IFC will own a minority stake in Global Partnership for Ethiopia BV (GPE), while Safaricom PLC will be the majority shareholder. For context, the consortium, also known as the Global Partnership for Ethiopia BV (GPE), includes Vodafone, Vodacom, Sumitomo Corporation, and British International Investment (BII). “With IFC coming on board as an equity partner, their experience in global operations and the stature of their investment brings a lot of praise and respect to the board. We look forward to their input in helping us make strides in the Ethiopian market,” Safaricom Ethiopia Chairman, Michael Joseph, said. Additionally, MIGA will offer 10-year guarantees worth $1 billion (KSh143.1 billion) to cover the equity investments made by Safaricom Ethiopia’s shareholders. Besides, the MIGA Guarantee Facility will contribute $76 million (KSh10.9 billion) towards the MIGA guarantees. What’s more, in May 2023, Safaricom's mobile money service, M-Pesa, received a licence to launch the service in Ethiopia. Thus, M-Pesa will reportedly launch in the third quarter of the financial year 2023/24.

PayPal's stablecoin I have to return Victoria's baby. It's been an amazing week taking care of Techpoint Digest for Victoria, and you guys have been an awesome audience. Special thanks to Leonard Igweokolo: Thank you for reaching out; it honestly warmed my heart. And guys, if Victoria asks if you enjoyed my newsletters, please say you loved them; it's the criterion for getting the coconut bread she promised me for taking care of her baby. Anyway, here's what I have for you today: PayPal's stablecoin Kenyan police raid Worldcoin warehouse Buguard's $500k seed round PayPal has launched a stablecoin PayPal USD, or PYUSD: That's the name of PayPal's stablecoin, which launched on Monday, August 7, 2023. Per TechCrunch, the stablecoin was issued by New York-based blockchain company, Paxos Trust Company and will be backed by the US dollar, short-term treasuries, and other cash equivalents. What's a stablecoin: They are a type of crypto, hence the name, stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, which makes them risky, not just for investment, but as a means of exchange. For instance, if I purchase $2 worth of coconut bread from Victoria and pay her the Bitcoin equivalent, there's a good chance the value of that Bitcoin could drop or increase in a few hours. However, cryptocurrencies are great for transactions as they are borderless, fast, and cheap. These factors necessitated the need for a stable version of them. Why does PYUSD matter? Well, if you thought crypto was dead, this is a way to tell you it is very much alive. PayPal is a $71 billion fintech company that processed over $1 trillion worth of transactions in 2022. If it's betting on crypto, then it could only be a matter of time before we start seeing other fintech companies doing the same. Will PayPal be opened to Nigerians finally? Currently, when you set up a PayPal account in Nigeria, you're only capable of sending money but not receiving it. But will this decision change that? Well, this isn't PayPal's first foray into crypto. In 2021, it launched Checkout with Crypto to enable users to make online payments with crypto and Nigerians still can't receive funds with PayPal, my guess is, nothing will change this time. Kenyan police raid Worldcoin warehouse Police officers in Kenya have raided a warehouse in Nairobi belonging to crypto company, Worldcoin. Armed with a search warrant, the cops reportedly broke into the property located along Mombasa Road on Saturday, August 5, 2023. Why did they raid the warehouse? To seize documents containing and equipment holding the data of Kenyans. Kenya already expressed its distrust for the Worldcoin project when it suspended the crypto company's activities in the country last week. Worldcoin's aim is to create a global database for identity verification by scanning the iris of everyone across the globe. Kenya is the first African country it launched in, and its troubles in the East African nation are mounting. Kenya's Data Commissioner, Immaculate Kassait, said Worldcoin's parent company, Tools for Humanity, "did not disclose its true intentions during registration." It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. In the meantime, you can check out my article about everything you need to know about Worldcoin here. Buguard's $500k seed Cairo-based cybersecurity and dark web monitoring company, Buguard has closed a $500,000 seed round led by A15 with participation from angel investors. Buguard's security services include penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and phishing simulation. Startups such as Fawry, MaxAB, Eksab, and Rabbit are some of the businesses that use Buguard's cyber security services. Founder and CTO of the company, Youssef Mohamed, said, “We already have a global base with clients from all over the world, but our immediate strategy is to grow even stronger." Buguard will use the funding to expand its team, focusing on product, sales, and channel partnerships. Mohamed also said the company is looking forward to expanding into Saudi Arabia this year.
Kenyan police raid Worldcoin warehouse, confiscate equipment and documents for analysis The news: Police officers in Kenya have raided a warehouse in Nairobi belonging to the crypto company, Worldcoin. Machines and documents belonging to the company were seized by law enforcement officers during the raid. The raid comes after Kenyan authorities suspended the activities of Worldcoin over data concerns. Reportedly armed with a search warrant and backed by multi-agency officials, a team of police officers have raided the wares house of crypto and identity verification company, Worldcoin. A local media platform, KahawaTungu, reported that the officers broke into the warehouse located along Mombasa Road on Saturday, August 5, 2023. Kenya's Data Commissioner, Immaculate Kassait, said Worldcoin's parent company, Tools for Humanity, "did not disclose its true intentions during registration." Data collected from the warehouse will be taken to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis. This news comes after a few days after Kenyan authorities suspended the activities of Worldcoin in the country due to data concerns. They said the company's activities will remain suspended until relevant public agencies can certify that it poses no risk to Kenyans. The project which was founded by Sam Altman, one of the brains behind OpenAI (ChatGPT), was launched to create a global financial database for everyone in the world. The project uses a device called an orb to scan people's eyes and give them a World ID, also known as "proof of personhood." This World ID helps people verify their identity on online platforms without having to reveal their names or other personal data. While Worldcoin is registered as a data controller in Kenya, authorities say it is not regulated.
Why are Kenyans scanning their eyes for $50? 11 questions about Worldcoin answered By now you've most likely seen or heard about Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project paying people to scan their eyes to create a global database of humans around the world. Worldcoin launched on July 24 2023 and also has more than 2.1 million signups. New people are signing up for WorldCoin every eight seconds. There are long queues in various locations globally, including Kenya, signing up for the crypto project and earning a $50 signup bonus. But what is Worldcoin? Why is it being created, and why is it scanning our iris? these are some of the questions we'll be answering in this article. What is Worldcoin? WorldCoin is a global financial system and identity system that is accessible to everyone in the world. This system is built on a blockchain that makes its control decentralised. According to WorldCoin, "It’s designed to be decentralised, meaning that ultimately its supervision and decision making will rest with its community of users." You can also define Worldcoin as a cryptocurrency and digital identification system. This is because it has a crypto token (WLD) and it takes people's biometric data with a device called the Orb. What is Worldcoin's goal? Worldcoin has two goals: Create an identification system that can differentiate humans from AI. Create a global financial network accessible to everyone on Earth. AI has been growing furiously in the past year. From ChatGPT which can write you an article within a few seconds to Midjourney, capable of re-creating pictures of you in different scenarios. Worldcoin believes the best way to tell humans from AI is through biometric verification. However, it wants people to be able to identify themselves anonymously. This means identifying yourself without giving away personal information like your name. This identification system is called World ID. It ensures only humans can signup because it requires an iris scan, a unique biometric feature. Once you have the World ID, you are a part of Worldcoin's financial network. How will Worldcoin work? Worldcoin will work on the blockchain just like Bitcoin. It will store the World IDs and transactions on the blockchain. Everyone signed up on the platform will also get a say on what happens on the platform. According to the website, owning the WLD token gives users ownership and access to the Worldcoin protocol. This could mean that Worldcoin will work like a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) which means people who own the WLD token will be able to vote on key decisions about the Worldcoin protocol. How do you signup for Worldcoin? To signup for Worldcoin, you need the World App. This app helps you create a Worldcoin account that gives you access to the Worldcoin wallet which can be used to store the WLD tokens, bitcoin, ethereum and other supported cryptocurrencies. You can use the app without scanning your iris. If you wish to get Worldcoin tokens, however, you need to signup for World ID which means scanning your eyes with the Orb and verifying your "unique personhood." Why is Worldcoin scanning your iris? Worldcoin is scanning your iris to "verify your uniqueness" or "unique personhood." To tell humans apart from AI, Worldcoin believes it needs unique biometric data. Why not fingerprint? Because Worldcoin wants to identify people without using personal data such as names it is not taking biometric data that is already associated with a person's data. Where can you scan your iris in Nigeria? There are currently no Worldcoin operators in Nigeria. You can apply to be a Worldcoin operator here. Where can you scan your iris in Ghana? Ghana is currently not on the list of countries where Orb operators are present. Where can you scan your iris in Kenya? Kenya is the only African country with an Orb operator out of the 18 countries listed on the Worldcoin website. The Orb operator is at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. How much do you get for scanning your iris? You get 25 WLD tokens which are worth $50. What can you do with WLD tokens? You can exchange the WLD tokens to pay for goods and services directly or exchange them for fiat currency. They are also governance tokens, which means it gives you voting rights when it comes to deciding the fate of the protocol.

Ministerial tech bro Hello, Bolu here, Today we're discussing: Traction's $6 million seed Uber's first profit Quidax delisted from Playstore TikTok is now banned in Senegal Just three days after announcing its second Internet shutdown of the year, Senegal has banned social media platform, TikTok. Per Reuters, the Senegalese government blocked the platform to clamp down on dissent. Moussa Bocar Thiam: The Senegalese Communications Minister, who announced Senegal's Internet shutdown on Monday, also had something to say about the TikTok ban. "The TikTok application is the social network favoured by people with bad intentions to spread hateful and subversive messages," Thiam said. TikTok is important: While Thiam believes TikTok is the go-to platform for people who want to spread hateful messages, some street vendors need the platform to boost online sales. One vendor told Reuters that being blocked from TikTok was "a pain. In the end, you're tired and discouraged." Zoom out: During Senegal's first Internet shutdown, a Tweeter who tweeted at SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, to provide Internet access to Starlink, was reportedly killed by security forces afterwards. Ministerial tech bro Bosun Tijani, the Co-founder and CEO of Nigeria's biggest tech hub, Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB), has been added to the second batch of President Bola Tinubu's ministerial list. OG tech bro: From working as a Business Development Manager with DeliveryKing to serving as Deployment Lead (Africa) with Hewlett Packard (HP) Global Micro-enterprises Acceleration Programme (GMEAP), Tijani's contribution to the tech space is quite deep. Under his leadership, CcHUB has grown from its humble beginnings in Yaba, Lagos, to acquiring major hubs across Africa, making it a pan-African tech incubator, empowering young people with the tools, communities, and capital they need to launch impactful ventures. Tijani's nomination is an indication that Nigeria wants to take its ecosystem seriously. I'm almost sure everyone in the tech space is rooting for Tijani, but as we await the final decision, I hope it'll be great for the tech ecosystem. Kenya suspends Worldcoin's activities Kenya's Ministry of Interior and National Administration has suspended the activities of Worldcoin, a crypto project that scans people's iris to create a global financial and identity database for humans. The Kenyan government says it is concerned about the project as it involves "registration of citizens through collection of eyeball/iris data." What is Worldcoin: Worldcoin is a crypto project that wants to create a global financial and identity network. Why? Well, the Co-founder, Sam Altman, who is also the CEO of AI company, OpenAI (ChatGPT), said Worldcoin will help us tell humans apart from AI. To be fair AI has gotten incredibly good over the years, and it's necessary to start taking precautionary measures. What's with the iris scan? One thing we have that AI doesn't have yet is biometric data. Like a fingerprint, there's a unique iris to every human being. Worldcoin wants you to be able to identify yourself without revealing any personal info. I call it anonymous identity. Since fingerprints are already associated with people's info in most places, Worldcoin went for another unique form of identification. Once you signup and get your iris scanned, you get a World ID and a $54 sign-up bonus. Not so fast! Before you go in search of the nearest Worldcoin vendor to make a quick $54, you should know there are some controversies surrounding this project. For example, people in the US are not paid $54 to scan their iris. The project is also affiliated with Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX Founder currently facing fraud charges. I'm still going to scan my eyes despite all these, but Nigeria doesn't have a Worldcoin Orb operator yet
Diligence Africa wants to help African startups and investors make smarter investment decisions Charlie Javice was indicted in May 2023 for defrauding JP Morgan Chase. The bank had acquired Frank — Javice's financial aid startup — for $175 million, but discovered that user numbers had been severely blown out of proportion. Such incidents are not rare. Elizabeth Holmes is currently serving an 11-year sentence. Holmes, 39, was found guilty of wire fraud after reports revealed that Theranos' technology did not work as advertised. Similarly, Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange, FTX, is being charged with eight criminal charges, including money laundering, securities, and commodities fraud. Closer home, Prince Boakye Boampong, CEO of Dash, a Ghanaian fintech startup, was allegedly suspended for financial misreporting. What these four incidents have in common is startup founders in unsavoury behaviour before or after receiving external investment. But something else they all have in common is what appears to be lax due diligence by investors. Despite raising nearly $2 billion from a star-studded list of investors, some passed on investing in FTX due to concerns discovered while conducting due diligence. Alex Pack, Managing Partner of Hack VC told CNBC that his firm discovered a massive loss that they struggled to understand while conducting due diligence between 2018 and 2019. Stories like these provided the motivation for two women to start Diligence Africa, a startup that helps founders and investors with the due diligence process. Navigating venture capital as an outsider There’s a defined path to take if you want to be a medical doctor. In most parts of the world, that begins with studying a five-year course. The same applies if you want to become a lawyer. But what if you want to work in venture capital? What do you need to know? Are there courses you can take in the university? These were some of the questions that plagued Damilola Thompson when she decided to work in venture capital. A lawyer, Thompson began her career helping entrepreneurs with incorporation and other legal issues, but she soon noticed a pattern. Most of them had limited financing options outside loans from commercial banks. Looking for ways to help, she researched alternative financing options and stumbled on an article about a startup that had raised money from venture capitalists. That was her introduction to venture capital. A few months later, Eghosa Omoigui, asked the law firm she worked with to come on as counsels for his new fund, EchoVC. “As a lawyer, the client engagement is very transactional. Once you're done negotiating term sheets and the investment documents, you generally hand over the transaction to the partner driving the investment, who then manages the relationship with entrepreneurs. I did that long enough to realise that my passion was working directly with the entrepreneurs and helping them figure out their journey all the way.” With this discovery, she started researching how a lawyer could become a VC. Her search led her to online courses and books, but after going through them, she realised she still lacked practical experience. Her next action was going to startup events, speaking, and telling people how she could help their startups. Some conversations later, she landed a role at EchoVC as an in-house counsel. Over the next five years, she wore different hats, with her last role being Investor and vice president of corporate development. During her time at EchoVC, she set up Ventures Dialogue — a non-profit — with some friends to help startup founders preparing to raise venture capital and worked with more than one thousand entrepreneurs. Keen to get experience as an operator, she joined Trade X in 2021 to lead its expansion efforts, leaving in December 2022 to start Diligence Africa with Olaide Olusoji-Oke, a colleague from her EchoVC days. Due diligence matters Having worked in venture capital and with startups, both founders are aware of the importance of the due diligence process for all parties involved. “I know, as an investor, how that impacts your business. Essentially, it's the updates that you get from your portfolio companies that you leverage to provide reports to your limited partners. And when you're not able to provide this kind of information, it impacts your ability to fundraise subsequently.” Although some founders may baulk at the thought of an investor conducting due diligence, she stresses that it is a crucial part of the investment process. VCs need to get an adequate understanding of a startup before making an investment decision, hence the due diligence process. This mindset forms the core of the startup’s services: serving startups and investors. Diligence Africa’s process allows them to request a due diligence report from startups. When this request is made, the Diligence Africa team carries out a thorough review of the startup and presents it with a report and an uneditable digital badge. If you're wondering why a startup founder should be bothered about conducting due diligence on their startup, Thompson explains that it shows how serious a founder is, and gives some assurance to potential investors. But equally important is its role in improving a startup's ability to raise capital. Conducting due diligence on a company is not a walk in the park and most investors don't want to do it for reasons including team size and capacity, cost, and time. "They would instead leave that to the lead investor, and a lot of times, that stalls the fundraising conversation because until the founder can find a lead, there's almost nothing that can be done. And so what we're saying is that since one of the tasks of a lead investor is to conduct due diligence into the company, we are taking on that first task of due diligence into startups." A due diligence check is meant to ascertain the state of a business, and Diligence Africa highlights any unappealing details it discovers. This helps the company remain neutral, as the report works similarly to a financial audit. Founders can then address the concerns raised, making them more prepared for investment. "Diligence Africa is pioneering the first-ever pipeline of diligence-ready startups by enabling founders to proactively request due diligence reports, demonstrating their readiness to receive venture capital investments from investors and increasing their chances of attracting investment, partnerships, or acquisition opportunities." How Diligence Africa works Without organisations like Diligence Africa, investors would often outsource certain parts of the due diligence process to law or audit firms. However, Diligence Africa's straightforward process makes it a one-stop-shop for all types of due diligence. Potential clients typically get in touch with the firm through its website or partners. Once a request is approved, they sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect the data that they share. For founders, the Diligence Africa team goes into their data room to evaluate all their documents and ensure that they check out. With services that range from risk intelligence diligence to transaction diligence and investigative diligence, clients can choose the specific services they need. But beyond due diligence services, the firm also provides fractional CFO services and governance/compliance services for startups. Challenges, opportunities, and scaling Diligence Africa’s value proposition has been an easy sell for investors, considering they’ve always needed these services. But it has not been the same for founders. While many understand what due diligence entails, she points out that many don’t see its value so the firm has put a lot of emphasis on education. “We're having conversations with founders, VC firms, Limited Partners, Advisory firms, DFIs, etc., many of whom understand the essence and purpose of our services. But when we share experiences from what is actually happening in the market, they get a deeper context and realisation and understand why our services are critical to the growth of the startup ecosystem.” Most of the startup’s processes are manual, but Thompson explains that the plan is to automate certain parts of the business. “We believe that there's some part of our diligence processes that will still be manual because sometimes you can only get the best information when you engage with someone in person.” With five team members and partners across Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda, the startup's immediate goal is to work with more clients over the next year. Thompson is confident that the venture capital slowdown will end soon, and when that happens, she hopes that Diligence Africa is properly positioned to work with the startups and VCs making deals.
Uber's first profit in 14 years Meta wants to launch human-level AI chatbots that will be called Personas. Basically, the chatbot will have a personality. Some employees at Meta said there's a prototype of the chatbot that has the personality of Abraham Lincoln. The chatbot is part of Meta's retention plan for Threads and its other platforms. There's no doubt 2023 is Mark Zuckerberg's "go big or go home year," but let's see what happens. Away from Meta, here's what I have for you today: Traction's $6 million seed Uber's first profit Quidax delisted from Playstore Traction's $6 million seed Traction, a Nigerian fintech startup that makes it easy for small businesses to get access to digital finance services, has raised $6 million in a seed round led by Pan-African investor, Ventures Platform and Multiply Partners. P1 Ventures also participated in the round. Founded by Mayowa Alli and Dolapo Adejuyigbe in 2020, the platform helps small businesses record sales, handle inventory, manage customers, and use PoS terminals to accept payments. The McKinsey-trained founders got the idea for the startups after brainstorming ways to increase financial inclusion levels in Nigeria. They told TechCrunch that banks did not understand small businesses enough to create the kind of financial services that would work for them. Unlike OPay, Moniepoint and its other competitors, Traction doesn't use the agent-banking model. The solution is built for merchants from the get-go, meaning anyone with a Traction PoS is a small business owner rather than a banking agent. The startup currently serves over 70,000 businesses in Nigeria and has disbursed ₦2 billion ($2.6 million) in loans. Uber records its first profit Uber just recorded its first operating profit after 14 years of existence. The US ride-hailing company reported a $326 million operating profit for Q2 2023 as opposed to a loss of $713 million in the same period last year. Initially expected to make a $49.2 million loss, Uber smashed expectations with a $394 million net profit. One of the major factors that contributed to Uber's net gain was a 22% rise in trips on the platform and cost discipline. Where's Africa in all of this? Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) were the second biggest earners — $2.4 billion — out of the four regions highlighted. The US and Canada remain the cash cows bringing in a revenue of $5.1 billion. Asia Pacific and Latin America brought in $1 billion and $627 million respectively. Uber still sucks: In a recent interview with Wired Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi said, "Once we get profitable, I’m going to come up with some other reason why we suck. Because that gets the team psyched up. We have an underdog mentality I never want to lose," Quidax gets delisted from Google Play on its fifth birthday Right now, running a crypto business anywhere in the world is the ultimate ghetto. Not to exaggerate, but things have been hard for crypto startups. Crypto death: Four Africa-focused crypto startups have shut down between October 2022 and now, but Quidax is one of the few still standing Unfortunately, the company got delisted from Google Play yesterday, the same day it was celebrating being in operation for five years. Founder and CEO, Buchi Okoro, announced on Twitter, while also revealing that the company's Twitter account had been blocked. Zoom out: Although Quidax has been able to survive the harsh crypto winter, it had to trim its workforce in 2022, with up to 100 employees getting laid off. With only a handful of crypto startups still standing, I do wish Quidax all the best.

Tradecurve (TCRV) leads the DeFi market expansion with novel The decentralized finance market is experiencing a huge surge of expansion, and at the forefront is Tradecurve (TCRV). Despite being a new DeFi project, Tradecurve has been able to command as much attention as it has because of its unique use case. Tradecurve is building what will become the first hybrid trading platform where users will be able to access and trade financial instruments from the global derivatives market. On the platform, users will be able to trade stocks, options, forex, crypto, and commodities with only one account. This will actively solve the problem traders face in managing multiple accounts. In addition, it will link Tradecurve to one of the biggest markets in the world. In June 2022, the Bank for International Settlement estimated that the global derivatives market was worth $632 trillion. This will give Tradecurve more liquidity than every other DeFi project. By solving a major problem with DeFi, Tradecurve has earned a frontrunner seat in the next major expansion. Crypto analysts have predicted that the utility token of Tradecurve, TCRV, will also be positively impacted by its market. At press time, TCRV trades at $0.025 per token in its fifth presale stage but is expected to hit a high of $0.029 in the coming week. Long-term predictions peg the price of TCRV at $1.5 before the end of this year, making it one of 2023’s biggest gainers.

SEC Nigeria confirms its ban on the global crypto exchange, Binance, warns other unregistered exchanges against soliciting Nigerian investors The news: Nigeria's Securities Exchange Commission, (SEC) has declared global crypto exchange, Binance, illegal in the country. It confirmed that its secular from June 9, 2023, referring to Binance Nigeria Limited, was directed at binance.com. The commission has also warned other crypto investment platforms from soliciting Nigerian investors. On June 9, 2023, the SEC declared Binance Nigeria Limited illegal in Nigeria. Binance, however, told Techpoint Africa that is it not affiliated with the entity, "Binance Nigeria Limited." On Friday, July 28, 2023, the SEC clarified that it was referring to Binance by including its website, binance.com. The circular read, "The Commission again reiterates that the activities of Binance, https://www.binance.com and any such other platform through which the Company solicits investors are neither registered nor regulated by the Commission and its operations in Nigeria are therefore illegal." SEC does not trust crypto The SEC also warned the public against investing in crypto assets saying they "have a high level of risk and may result in total loss of investments." It also discouraged investing with or in crypto platforms not registered or regulated by the SEC. It has issued a warning to unregistered platforms against soliciting Nigerian investors. Regulations on crypto in Nigeria so far On Friday, May 13, 2022, the SEC issued rules and guidelines for all crypto and digital asset service providers in the country. SEC regulations: Nigeria Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years The SEC highlighted new licence requirements for platforms that deal with digital assets, categorisation of the platforms, and guidelines for their operations. Registering a crypto exchange in Nigeria requires a minimum paid-up capital of $1.2 million, a $72,000 registration fee, a $722 processing fee and a $240 application fee. The SEC's declaration of Binance as illegal hints at an attempt to get the crypto exchange and many others to get registered in the country and follow its guidelines for regulating crypto exchanges. While Binance has been granted permission and registration to operate in several countries, South Africa is the only African country where it has officially gotten permission to operate.
Problems at OPay? Victoria lied to you, I'm not fun. As you already know, Victoria is going on a much-needed break, and she has entrusted me with keeping Techpoint Digest delivered to your inbox. In her last email to you, she said I'm fun, but this couldn't be further from the truth. I'm actually super fun, and I'll do my best to keep the newsletter as engaging as possible. In the meantime, tell me what you like the most about Victoria's newsletters, and I'll try to maintain the standard. Without further ado, here's what I have for you today: OPay CEO steps down. Senegal's second Internet shutdown in 2023. Threads loses 50% of its users. OPay CEO steps down Olu Akanmu has stepped down as OPay-Nigeria's CEO, two years after he took office. Akanmu announced his departure from the fintech company on Twitter (now X), saying it was the end of one chapter and he was moving on to the next. Akanmu had a great track record at OPay. As of December 2022, OPay had the largest agency banking network in Nigeria with over 500,000 agents. I made a list of companies with the most PoS agents in Nigeria as of December 2022, you can check it out here. Keep in mind that much has changed since 2022, and a little birdie told me that Moniepoint now has the largest agency banking network in the country. I'll give you the actual figures if you ask nicely. Zoom out: Akanmu is not the only C-level employee who recently left OPay. Dotun Adekunle left his role as CTO in October 2022. Olaniyi Alao, a former Compliance Officer at OPay, also left the company for Paystack this year. Something's definitely up at OPay. Senegal's second Internet shutdown in 2023 Unfortunately, people in Senegal might not be able to read this newsletter because their communications minister, Moussa Bocar Thiam, announced the country's second Internet shutdown in 2023, starting yesterday. The first one was in June 2023. Both times, the decision followed protests regarding the opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko. Sonko was sentenced to two years in prison in June for "corrupting the youths." The decision sparked violent protests across the country, leading to the death of 15 people. Internet shutdowns are costly. Senegal's last shutdown cost the country $300,000 every hour. This time, it could be much worse, as the constant shutdowns could cause foreign investors to lose confidence in the country. Zuck's Threads is losing users Meta's Twitter rival, Threads, made history when it crossed 100 million signups in just five days. However, it's not rainbows and unicorns again for Threads as it has lost half of its users. What really happened? According to an internal meeting heard by Reuters, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that the platform had lost half of its users. Interestingly, Threads performed even better than Meta executives anticipated. The company is now going to focus on adding features that will keep users on the platform for longer. I'm not very fond of Threads because . Or maybe I should see a therapist.
OPay CEO, Olu Akanmu steps down The news: OPay CEO, Olu Akanmu steps down. He announced this on Monday, July 31, 2023, on Twitter. The former OPay boss said it was the end of a chapter and the beginning of a new one. He highlighted success stories the fintech company has achieved under him and said, "There is still so much to be done." Olu Akanmu is stepping down as CEO of Opay Nigeria after two years. Akanmu said on Twitter that it was the end of one chapter and he was moving on to the next. While Akanmu has led the fintech to become one of the companies with the largest agent banking networks in Nigeria, —over 500,000 — he said there was still so much more to be done. He pointed out how the cash crunch earlier this year revealed that there are still a lot of Nigerians who do not have access to the digital financial system. Akanmu has been the CEO of OPay for two years, but he has over 13 years of experience in the financial sector. Akanmu also has experience in telecommunications. He was General Manager-Consumer Marketing at MTN between 2001 and 2007. He also worked for Airtel Nigeria as the Chief Marketing Officer for a year. Before becoming CEO of OPay Nigeria, Akanmu led retail banking at First City Monument Bank (FCMB) for over eight years. While Akanmu did not reveal where he'll be taking up employment next, his tweet shows he's concerned about creating access to the digital finance system. Meanwhile, OPay has announced the appointment of Dauda Gotring as the incoming MD of the company. Before Gotring can become MD, however, the Central Bank of Nigeria has to sign off on it.

Senegalese communications minister announces a second Internet shutdown in 2023 Senegal has shut down access to the Internet, beginning today, Monday, July 31, 2023. The country's communications minister, Moussa Bocar Thiam, made this known in a statement, while directing telecommunications companies to "comply with the notified requirements." This is the second time the West African country has restricted access to the Internet, with the last coming in June 2023. Both times, the decision has followed protests regarding opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko. Sonko was sentenced to two years in prison in June for "corrupting the youths." The decision sparked violent protests across the country, leading to the deaths of 15 people. Sonko was arrested on Friday, July 28, 2023. The state prosecutor swiftly charged him with calling for insurrection, undermining state security, criminal association with a terrorist body, and theft. These charges, the state prosecutor said, are unconnected to the previous charges of corrupting Senegal's youth. In response, Sonko has embarked on a hunger strike to protest the decision, which he claims is intended to prevent him from contesting in next year's presidential elections.

South African telco to launch smartphones in September 2023 Will you miss me when I’m gone? Earlier this month, someone asked me and some other people this question. Unlike most of the others who first expressed surprise or curiosity, I responded in the affirmative before asking why. As you might have guessed, I'll be away for a while — just a week. My coworker, Bolu, will fill in for me beginning tomorrow. Treat him nicely. I'm sure you'll enjoy his newsletters because he is a fun person. I’ll see you next week Tuesday, okay? And if you won’t miss me, that's fine. Please, open the newsletter this week, and send your friends and haters this subscription link. Here's what I've got for you today: South African telco to launch locally manufactured smartphones in September 2023 FCT's Commissioner of Police warns Nigerians Airtel Uganda to launch 5G South African telco to launch locally manufactured smartphones in September 2023 South African telco, Bam Telecoms, plans to launch its locally manufactured smartphone line in September 2023. One report shows that 43.48 million South Africans (72.3% of the population) use the Internet as of January 2023. The black-owned telco intends to close the digital divide in South Africa by giving the local market affordable, quality, 4G-enabled phones, tablets, and smart technologies. How will it accomplish this? The telco says it will realise this via partnerships. It has partnered with local and international players, including ZTE, Dahua Technology, Digit, Bam Forensic Institute, and Providence Software Solutions. Currently, Bam Telecoms runs two factories in South Africa, one in the Eastern Cape's East London Industrial Development Zone and the other in KwaZulu-Natal. But because it is still assembling devices in China, it hasn’t started production yet. Its research and development unit, focused on creating "advanced devices by South Africans for Africans," is located near the company's head office in Rosebank, Johannesburg. Sidebar Alert: In May 2023, the Kenyan government announced that it would release its first consignment of one million locally assembled smartphones in July at a retail price of $40 (Ksh 5,506). This is the last day of July and the government has yet to announce the launch. Or will it do that today? This makes me wonder if Bam's locally produced smartphone line would be available by September. I believe time will tell. FCT's Commissioner of Police warns Nigerians A bird told me last week that some Nigerians have been using the Federal Capital Territory's (FCT) police emergency numbers to obtain loans from digital lending platforms. I couldn't help but laugh. "Is this the way forward, Nigerians?" I wondered. Jokes apart, the FCT Commissioner of Police, Haruna Garba, revealed this last Friday. He added that non-state actors had also been using the police emergency lines for pranks aimed at misleading the public and those applying for loans. He warned those involved to stop and only use the lines for their intended use because the police would deliberately apprehend and prosecute those responsible for these illegal activities. Sidebar Alert: In July, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) announced that it’d ask Google to remove loan apps that harass customers from its Play Store. Airtel Uganda to launch 5G This week, Airtel Uganda intends to deploy 5G gear at 50 sites throughout central Kampala, including Parliament Avenue, Fairway, Speke Apartments, and Crested Towers. After conducting successful tests at 11 sites in Kampala, the telco declared on February 21, 2023 that their 4G network was 5G ready and that they had applied for the necessary spectrum to begin implementing this ground-breaking technology. Airtel Uganda’s Managing Director, Manoj Murali, said that by the end of 2023, they will have expanded to other major towns in deeper regions. Murali also noted that Airtel would soon communicate a list of its rollout plans and would launch each of its more than 2,500 sites across the country one at a time. At the government's auction last month, Airtel and MTN won 5G frequencies in the country. The Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) granted the operators spectrum access, allowing them to begin their 5G rollouts, with MTN launching soon.

Everything you need to know about the eNaira, Nigeria's digital currency Nigeria's eNaira is Africa's first central bank digital currency (CBDC) and one of the 11 active CBDCs in the world. The eNaira is Nigeria's way of enabling the use of blockchain — a technology popularised by cryptocurrencies — in mainstream finance. It is also another way to rival cryptocurrencies, which have become increasingly popular among young Nigerians. It was touted to aid financial inclusion in Nigeria, cross-border transactions, and direct payments from the government to citizens. However, for citizens to take advantage of the eNaira's benefits, it is important to understand what they are. This article will be a guide to everything you need to know about the eNaira. What are central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)? Central bank digital currencies are digital versions of a country's currency. To understand them better, you need to know what digital currencies are. Digital currencies, as the name implies, are currencies that exist only digitally. An example of a digital currency is bitcoin or ethereum. They use complex encryption techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new currencies. They also operate on the blockchain, a digital ledger that stores the transaction history of digital currencies. When a central bank like the CBN decides to create something like bitcoin, it is called a CBDC. What is the benefit of creating CBDCs? Central banks want to create digital versions of their currencies to enjoy some of the perks that come with the likes of bitcoin and ethereum. One advantage of digital currencies is their low transaction cost because there are no intermediaries involved. For example, when you're using fiat currencies (the opposite of digital currencies) like the naira or dollar for transactions, they go through many people, which increases transaction costs. Depending on the type of transaction, the intermediaries are usually banks, a card scheme like Visa or Mastercard, or even the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS). But with digital currencies, a secure and direct link is created between the two parties to the transaction, reducing cost, making cross-border transactions seamless, and reducing transaction time. Why the eNaira was created One of the reasons why the eNaira was created was because of the FOMO around CBDCs. According to a 2021 study by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), 90% of the central banks in the world were considering creating CBDCs. However, CBDCs do have features that can help a country's financial system. Goals and objectives of the eNaira Aid financial inclusion Improve payment efficiency Improve revenue and tax collection Direct payments to citizens by the government eNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks How does the eNaira work? The eNaira operates on a blockchain like Bitcoin. Transactions are carried out on a blockchain network, allowing you and another eNaira user to send the currency peer-to-peer (P2P) without any intermediaries. How eNaira is different from Bitcoin While eNaira and Bitcoin transactions are carried out on the blockchain, they operate very differently. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency. This is because it operates on a public blockchain (the Bitcoin network), while the eNaira is a centralised digital currency that operates on a centralised or private blockchain. Public blockchains are accessible to anyone. For example, you can check Bicoin's transaction history on blockchain.com. Public blockchains also allow anyone anywhere with an Internet connection to create a wallet without any KYC. You can create a wallet and initiate transactions within seconds. The eNaira, however, operates on a private blockchainhttps://techpoint.africa/2021/08/03/experts-enaira-cbdc/. Unlike Bitcoin, where you have access to transaction records and create wallets instantly, the CBN keeps the eNaira closed off. Why the eNaira runs on a private blockchain The eNaira runs on a private blockchain because the CBN wants to control onboarding, KYC, and the creation of eNaira. This is why the CBN used the Hyperledger Fabric, a system that allows private organisations to create their private blockchain. What is the value of the eNaira? The eNaira has the same value as the naira. Essentially, one eNaira is equal to one naira. How does the CBN maintain the value of the eNaira? The CBN maintains a 1:1 naira to eNaira value by backing the available eNaira with a naira reserve. How the CBN issues and manages the eNaira The eNaira uses a platform model in which the CBN is the provider of the core ledger, the platform that will enable and record transactions. It will grant other financial players in the country access to build on the platform via APIs. eNaira: the role of banks Banks and other financial institutions are tasked with the distribution of the eNaira. They do this by creating additional payment functionality for the eNaira, thereby creating a payment ecosystem for it. How to use the eNaira To use the eNaira, you need to download the eNaira Speed Wallet app on your smartphone or dial the USSD code *997*50# if you have a feature phone. Types of eNaira wallets There are two types of eNaira wallets eNaira Speed Wallet (Combo) eNaira Speed App Lite Both wallets are similar with minor differences. The eNaira Speed Wallet (Combo) is a two-in-one app that can be used by individuals and merchants. The Speed App Lite, however, requires you to specify if you'll be using it as a merchant, business, or individual. What you need to open an eNaira wallet To open an eNaira wallet, you'll need your National Identification Number (NIN), phone number, and Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, not all tiers of the eNaira wallet require all these means of identification. The different tiers of eNaira wallet and their requirement Tiers Requirements Daily transaction limit: Tier 1, NIN and phone number ₦20,000, Tier 2: BVN and phone number₦ 200,000, Tier 3: BVN, phone number, and public utility receipt ₦500,000. How to fund your eNaira wallet Once you have created an eNaira wallet, you get a 10-digit wallet ID — a bank account equivalent. You can send money from your bank to your wallet using your wallet ID. Whether you're sending with your bank app, USSD code, or Internet banking platform, simply enter the wallet ID and choose eNaira as the bank you want to send to. Advantages of using the eNaira wallet Free transfers Fast transactions Quick setup time for people without bank accounts Disadvantages of using the eNaira Privacy: Unlike public blockchains like Bitcoin that can be used anonymously, the eNaira requires KYC protocols. The eNaira is a pioneer when it comes to CBDCs. While adoption has not caught on, it bodes well for the financial future of many Nigerians.
Sudanese group hacks Kenyan website This weekend is going to be a blast, right? After all, it's salary week. Have a good time! Take 500k (in whatever currency you use) from that total and treat yourself. And no, this is not me advising you to blow your savings. I intend to go out and have fun. I am sorry, but I will not reveal my plan. Not because I am not proud of it, but because I do not do it frequently. Please, leave your house this weekend, alright? I've got some news: Safaricom has launched Faraja, a no-interest credit service, for purchases up to KSh100,000 in value. Over 32 million Safaricom customers can make credit-based purchases from businesses accepting Lipa Na M-PESA and pay them in full within 30 days. One more thing: On this week's Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discussed several news items, including the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission delisting Sycamore and the Central Bank of Nigeria increasing the benchmark interest rate. Listen here. Here's what I've got for you today: Sudanese group hacks Kenyan platform Copia Global lays off 25% of its workforce Terragon's $9 million Series B Sudanese group hacks Kenya's platform A Sudanese hacker group known as "Anonymous Sudan" is said to have hacked into Kenya's eCitizen platform, disrupting its operations. Known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, this type of hacking disables a network, server, or website by flooding it with unnecessary Internet traffic, preventing authorised users from using its services. However, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary (CS) for ICT, Eliud Owalo, said the cyberattack was not strange. He added that the attack had not resulted in any data loss and that the government is working on corrective measures to address the current situation and seeking to establish a framework for risk mitigation to thwart potential attacks. Why the attack? The hacker group claim they have taken down several Kenyan websites in response to Kenya's supposed interference in Sudanese affairs. Since July 24, 2023, many government and private websites, including e-Citizen and NTSA, have experienced outages. This move has impacted several things, including applications for and renewals of licences, birth certificates, business registrations, marriage certificates, and passports. What prompted the attack? Hackers began attacking after seeing a video of a Sudanese General, Yasir Al-Atta, claiming that Kenya’s President, Williams Ruto, is connected to and supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) — paramilitary forces formerly operated by the Government of Sudan. The Kenyan President, however, refuted the accusations and reaffirmed his commitment to mediating a peaceful end to the conflict in Sudan. Since the country's former president, Omar al-Bashir, was ousted in a popular uprising in 2019, there has been conflict in Sudan. In addition to causing tension and displacement, the conflict also claimed thousands of lives. Copia Global lays off 25% of its workforce Kenyan eCommerce startup, Copia Global, is laying off 25% of its headcount, or about 350 people, in the country. Why? The company says it is optimising several crucial processes in Kenya to enhance customer service and foster sustained operating profitability due to the ongoing economic downturn and the constrained capital markets. Copia says it will carry out the process with due regard for all affected employees and in full compliance with Kenyan labour law. Thus, the company will give affected employees one month's notice and they will be required to leave Copia before September 2023. This action follows the dismissal of 50 workers in Kenya. The company suspended its operations in Uganda in April 2023, terminating over 300 employees there. The Kenyan-based eCommerce platform caters to African consumers with middle-to-low incomes by giving them access to a convenient shopping experience in the underserved market. Terragon's $9 million Series B Nigerian cloud analytics and marketing platform, Terragon, has raised a $9 million Series B round to strengthen cloud-native capabilities on its platform. Orange Ventures led the round, while TLcom Capital, LoftyInc, Sango Capital, VestedWorld, and Western Technology Investment (WTI) participated. Terragon, founded by Elo Umeh (CEO), converts telco channels into mobile advertising inventory and provides information on the continent's expanding consumer markets to its clients, primarily telecommunications and financial services firms. Adrenaline, one of its main offerings, is a telco-data monetisation solution that allows telcos to diversify their revenue streams and marketers to reach niche audiences they can’t access via traditional marketing channels. Additionally, the company’s tools allow Terragon's corporate clients to drill down on several behavioural and demographic information and connect to various touchpoints such as online payment and sales systems. The company plans to develop and accelerate locally tailored machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence to lay the groundwork for improved enterprise communication. It plans to use the funds to broaden its focus on mobile B2C messaging, backed by detailed consumer insights from "big data." The company, already operating in Ghana and Kenya, wants to expand throughout Africa.

CBN unfreezes accounts of Bamboo, Risevest, and Chaka The news: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unfrozen the accounts of Bamboo, Risevest, and others. The accounts were frozen in 2021, with CBN alleging they engaged in illicit forex transactions. While the CBN did not give reasons for lifting the ban on the accounts, it has instructed all concerned banks to inform the firms about the development. The CBN has ordered that the bank accounts of fintech investment firms; Bamboo, Rivevest, Chaka and 437 other companies should be unfrozen. The accounts were placed on a post-no-debit restriction which stopped them from making debit transactions. Essentially preventing them from taking money out of the account, but allowing inflows. According to Punch, the CBN circular notifying banks of the development read, "You are hereby directed to vacate the Post-No-Debit restriction placed on the accounts of the under-listed bank customers at our instance. You are also required to inform the concerned customers of the vacation accordingly." Why did CBN freeze Bamboo, Chaka and Risevest accounts? CBN froze the accounts of Bamboo, Rise, Chaka, and Trove in 2021. It said they were operating without a license as asset management companies. It said they were "utilising FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.” It argued that their accounts needed to be frozen for 180 days because they were making the naira weaker. Weren't the accounts unfrozen in 2022? There were news reports in June 2022 that a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the accounts of Bamboo and others to be unfrozen. However, with a new report today saying the accounts have been unfrozen, it is not clear if they were frozen again after June 2022 or if the ban on the accounts was not lifted despite the court order.

Nigerian Verve cardholders can now purchase apps in naira on Google Play Store Google has partnered with Verve, a Nigerian payment card brand, to allow Nigerians to buy apps on Google Play Store. Google will conduct Verve transactions in Naira (₦‎), and banks will treat these transactions as local. To use the service, visit Google Play Store, select the app you want to purchase, enter the desired amount, select "add credit or debit card," and, when prompted, enter your Verve card information. You can also visit pay.google.com, log in with your Gmail account, select 'Add a payment method,' enter your Verve card information, and save. After that, make your purchase by going back to the Play Store. This service is available to Android users with Verve cards. However, you can’t currently pay for YouTube Premium with your Verve card. Meanwhile, in July 2023, the Interswitch-owned company, Verve, reported it had issued over 50 million payment cards in Nigeria, indicating its dominance in the country. For context, data from Statista shows that as of January 2022, about 28% of cardholders in Nigeria had Mastercards, and about 18% had Visas. However, between 2019 and 2022, Verve was the most popular card in Nigeria, making up 54% of the cards used in Nigeria for PoS and online transactions. Vincent Ogbunude, Managing Director Verve International, said integrating with Google Play is a significant step towards realising Verve's vision of promoting financial inclusion. Verve has previously partnered with other businesses to advance financial inclusion in Nigeria. In 2022, the payments company collaborated with Opay to launch the OPay Verve instant debit card. The card, directly linked to OPay users' wallets, allows OPay users to use the new Instant Debit Card to make purchases from their wallets anywhere Verve is accepted, including PoS terminals, ATMs, grocery stores, restaurants, petrol stations, and online retailers. “The introduction of local payments with Verve cards is a significant milestone, enabling more Nigerians to participate in the app economy and access the apps they need," Anthea Crawford, Head of Retail and Payment Partnerships at Google Play, concludes.
Kenyan agritech startup, FarmWorks, raises a $4.1 million pre-Series A to use AI to improve production Kenyan agritech startup, FarmWorks, has disclosed its $4.1 million pre-Series A round to bolster its data analytics capabilities and use AI to improve production and impact planting and lending decisions. Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund led the round with participation from Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, several family offices, and angel investors. Launched in 2020 by Yi Li (CEO) and Peter Muthee, FarmWorks provides farmers with access to farm inputs and markets for their produce. The startup offers farmers pest control services and farm inputs. It also purchases the farmers’ produce for local or international sales. Additionally, it lends them farming tools. Over 2,000 smallholder farmers participate in FarmWorks' out-grower programme, which has enabled it to establish a supply chain network that guarantees the prompt delivery of high-quality produce. It says it sells 400 tonnes of produce monthly. It plans to grow its network of contract farmers in other regions within Kenya, in addition to the two counties in the country’s central region, where it is currently operational and has 16 collection centres. FarmWorks previously engaged in crop production on its farms, which have now become training centres. What’s more, the startup teaches farmers about good agricultural practices, which it models on trial farms.
Tradecurve Gearing Up to Rival ImmutableX and Vechain as the Best Cryptocurrencies of 2023 The platform Tradecurve (TCRV) has been making waves in the crypto world lately. Also, many investors are predicting that it could be the best cryptocurrency investment of 2023. It is an attractive option and it may be able to outpace ImmutableX (IMX) and Vechain (VET) as the go-to crypto investment for the year. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<< ImmutableX (IMX): A Look at Its Growth and Future Challenges ImmutableX (IMX), a second-layer protocol built on Ethereum's blockchain, has been receiving increasing attention due to its successful application of ZK-rollup technology. In fact, ImmutableX now has a partnership with GameStop to tokenize in-game assets on the blockchain. In terms of token value, Immutable X has witnessed significant growth since January 2023, rising by over 91% to reach a current ImmutableX price of around $0.71. Market experts project that the ImmutableX token could potentially escalate to $10 by the end of 2025. However, this bullish outlook depends on ImmutableX becoming the number one choice in the booming layer-2 market. With so many competing products, this may prove to be a challenge for the ImmutableX team. This is in direct contrast to Tradecurve, which is the first and currently the only hybrid-trading platform based on the blockchain. Vechain (VET): Examining Its Market Presence and Future Prospects Vechain (VET), with its robust technology infrastructure and partnerships with prominent businesses, has a well-established presence in the volatile crypto market. The platform Vechain provides a robust enterprise blockchain solution that is increasingly adopted by companies such as BMW, PwC, and Walmart China. VeChain's substantial partnerships led to a surge in its price from $0.18 to over $0.28. This was during the bull run in 2021. However, as the broad crypto bull run waned, Vechain's value has currently settled at $0.01868. It was a drop of 93% for Vechain holders who bought 'the top'. Despite the downward trend, market analysts remain bullish about Vechain. They cite Vechain's robust fundamentals. They also cite the growing adoption of its technology as reasons for potential price surges in the next bull run. This is due to occur after the Bitcoin (BTC) halving in 2024. Analysts have highlighted the $0.033 resistance level as a significant price point for Vechain. Breaking this resistance could propel Vechain beyond $0.10 in the long term. Tradecurve (TCRV): A New Wave in the Crypto World Tradecurve (TCRV) is making waves as a comprehensive hybrid exchange operating on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to empower global traders to deal with a broad spectrum of assets — including stocks, currencies, commodities, and indices — while ensuring user privacy through DeFi technology. Notably, Tradecurve prides itself on a hassle-free account registration process that requires just an email address. This approach conveniently sidesteps the typically tedious and stringent KYC protocols commonplace in other platforms. Tradecurve goes beyond being a simple exchange; it provides a holistic trading ecosystem that equips investors with an arsenal of potent trading tools. This includes AI-powered trading systems, copy trading facilities, and a hybrid trading exchange. Furthermore, Tradecurve is home to a trading academy that imparts crucial trading techniques to beginners and advanced traders alike. At the core of the Tradecurve platform is its native TCRV token, which confers various benefits to its holders. Simply hold TCRV on the platform to access copy trading tools, earn passive income through staking, and enjoy discounted trading fees. Currently, TCRV is priced at an attractive $0.025 during the ongoing fifth presale phase. Market pundits are forecasting an incredible surge of 5,000%, pushing the price to reach $1 by the conclusion of the presale. Further momentum could carry TCRV to achieve a stunning 100x jump following its listing on the Uniswap exchange.
Young African Catalysts gets into Techstars Toronto, rebrands to CatalyzU Today, Young African Catalysts is announcing its acceptance into Techstars Toronto and a rebrand to CatalyzU. CatalyzU joins 23 other startups from Canada and emerging markets in this cohort. Founded by former investors, Karl Nchite (CEO) and Luke Mostert (Chief Strategy Officer), CatalyzU is taking on the challenge of training and placing African talent into startups across the globe. Where startups like Andela have focused on technical talent, CatalyzU intends to focus on non-technical roles, such as sales, marketing, business development, and customer service. Its participation in Techstars will aid in this goal as it would have access to the accelerator's portfolio companies and partners. Per Mostert, the rebrand aligns with the startup's mission to educate and place people in jobs. Mostert previously worked as the Head of Investments at Future Africa, but will now lead CatalyzU's strategy, funding, partnerships, and marketing efforts. “Karl and I have fantastic networks across Africa, including the Young African Catalysts ecosystem, which includes fellows from the leading 65 African VC Funds. However, we don't have similarly broad networks in the US, and given the nascent nature of edtech and jobtech specific funding on the African continent, we want to tap into those specialised US funds. As the world’s largest pre-seed investor, Techstars has access to these networks and is willing to help us access them to unlock growth capital and networks that come with it,” he told Techpoint Africa. As part of their acceptance into the accelerator, CatalyzU will receive $120,000 from Techstars, which the founders say is part of the first tranche of their pre-seed round. Additionally, the startup has received angel investments from Paul Breloff, Founder of Accion Venture Labs & Shortlist Professionals; Toyosi Abolarin, Founder of Nigerian Web3 gaming platform, Awujo; and Robert Cole, Head of Investments at Tencent Europe. The startup intends to commence fundraising efforts for the second tranche of its pre-seed round after the end of the Techstars programme in October 2023. Nchite has been representing the startup in Toronto since July and cites Techstars' reach and influence on the African continent as a major motivation for joining the accelerator. "The experience has been amazing so far, we’ve been fully immersed in it, constantly surrounded by industry leaders trying to help us with core elements of our startup’s development. We’re thrilled about this experience as well as the invaluable relationships and partnerships that have already begun stemming," he said. In the face of slowing venture capital funding, Techstars has remained one of the most active investors globally and has invested in over 60 African startups since 2021. "The Techstars Toronto fund has now made 40 investments directly into African startups, making us one of the most active global direct investors on the continent in the entire world. What we immediately saw in CatalyzU was the platform they are building to support the rise of entrepreneurs themselves, it’s a foundation. We share their view that African entrepreneurs are young, talented, and unstoppable and we want CatalyzU to support our African portfolio, as a start," Sunil Sharma, Managing Director of Techstars Toronto said of the startup's mission.
BasiGo enters Rwanda In June 2023, President Ahmed Tinubu signed the students’ loan bill into law to offer students interest-free loans. The government has now stated that it will implement the plan before the start of the upcoming academic year in September. Also, Dele Alake, Special Adviser to the President, Special Duties, Communications, and Strategy, debunked rumours that the country's federal universities would see an increase in tuition fees. He said that the additional fees announced by some universities for services like hostel accommodation, registration, and laboratory fees were not tuition. What's more, the government has plans to use work-study programmes, merit-based scholarships, and grants to help committed students finish their education on time. Here's what I've got for you today: BasiGo enters Rwanda Vodacom discovers 49 stolen batteries Namibia passes crypto law BasiGo enters Rwanda Kenyan electric mobility startup, BasiGo, is expanding into Rwanda to address fleet shortage in the country. The company has partnered with AC Mobility, a Rwandan supplier of automated fare collection systems for public transportation, to carry out this expansion. The partnership will deliver electric buses to Kigali transport operators by October 2023 using BasiGo's Pay-As-You-Drive financing model. The model enables owners to buy electric buses on credit in addition to a daily subscription fee that covers the price of renting the battery, nightly charging at a BasiGo depot, and bus service and maintenance. BasiGo and AC Mobility intend to deliver 200 electric buses to Rwandan bus operators through this model by the end of 2024. Rwandan Infrastructure Minister, Ernest Nsabimana, says the buses will address ongoing issues with Kigali's public transportation system, which has been causing passengers inconvenience. Further, the Rwandan government has launched a programme to increase the number of public vehicles in Kigali rapidly and convert 20% of the fleet to electric buses by 2030. This move coincides with BasiGo's entry into the country. Founded in 2021, BasiGo was instrumental in getting electric buses into Nairobi's public transportation fleet. The company has sold 19 electric buses to the city’s public transportation companies, with over 100 more already reserved. In January 2023, BasiGo partnered with an automobile company, Associated Vehicle Assemblers Ltd (AVA), to assemble buses in Mombasa, a city in the country. In May 2023, the electric vehicle (EV) startup launched Kenya’s first public EV charging station connected via the new eMobility tariff in Nairobi's Buru Buru neighbourhood. Vodacom recovers 49 stolen batteries Vodacom, in collaboration with a specialised security company it hired, has recovered 49 stolen batteries from its base stations. Why is this important? Mobile network operators are increasingly worried about battery theft because it affects their ability to keep their uptime commitments to customers. These bateries act as a backup power source and is necessary to maintain connectivity during load shedding. What happened? Last week, an armed robbery in Kempton Park targeted one of Vodacom's manufacturing partners, stealing 700 batteries, 49 of which belonged to Vodacom. The South African mobile operator said that its security team and other security experts discovered the stolen batteries in a warehouse close to Musina, in Limpopo, retrieving all 49 batteries and returning them to its warehouse. However, network towers are not the only targets of battery theft. Vodacom Chief Risk Officer, Johan van Graan, said thieves are targeting different parts of the supply chain, from towers to manufacturers. However, Vodacom claims it has made significant investments to safeguard its backup power options. Van Graan says the company wants to send a clear message to criminals who target their base stations that they will be caught and prosecuted. Namibia passes crypto law Last week, the Namibian government signed a law to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VSAP). The VASP-regulating law was published in the country's Gazette on July 21, following approval by the Namibian National Assembly on July 6 and assent by President Hage Geingob on July 14. The Namibian Ministry of Finance will decide when the law goes into effect. The Namibia Virtual Assets Act 2023, as it is known, aims to designate a regulatory body to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges in the nation. It is the first law outlining how the country should regulate crypto-related activities. The law is expected to protect consumers, stop market abuse, and reduce the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing. Non-compliant providers could be subject to fines of up to 10 million Namibian dollars ($671,000) and ten years in jail. The Bank of Namibia, the country's central bank, also maintains that cryptocurrencies will not be legal tender. Botswana, Kenya, Mauritius, and Seychelles are other African countries with cryptocurrency laws. Recently, the financial regulator for South Africa announced that all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country must apply for licences by the end of 2023 to continue operating.

Uber and Bolt introduce audio recording but concerns remain over user privacy In 2019, Temidayo Adetola booked a ride to visit her mother-in-law in Lagos, Nigeria. But a few minutes into the ride, she ended it after the driver made suggestive comments about her body. The incident led her to add "Mrs" to her name on the app. "There is the respect they accord you when they know you are married," she told African Arguments. Adetola is one of several people who have been sexually harassed, robbed, and in some cases killed while using ride-hailing services in Africa. Riders are not the only ones who face danger on these apps. Drivers have reported being offered sexual favours in return for not paying the fare. This month, a Bolt driver in Abuja was killed following an argument over payment. These incidents are also not restricted to Africa. Between 2017 and 2018, Uber reported nearly 6,000 cases of sexual assault in the United States, while a woman fatally shot an Uber driver in June 2023. In response to these issues, ride-hailing companies have launched some features which they hope will help improve the safety of riders and drivers while using the apps. Some of these include a trip sharing option that allows users to share details of their trip with a trusted third party such as a friend or family member. Others include an emergency assist button, real-time selfie verification, and speed limit alerts. In July 2023, Bolt announced that it would launch an in-app audio recording feature in Nigeria and South Africa. Uber followed suit, announcing an audio recording feature in partnership with Sety, a Nigerian company. Uber has previously rolled out audio recording in some Latin American countries while Didi made audio recording mandatory in 2018. How does in-app audio recording work? Audio trip recording can be turned on at any time during the trip by either the driver or the rider. This recording can only be done during the trip and automatically ends once a ride is finished. Once started, recordings cannot be paused or stopped until the trip ends, but where a user receives a call while using the feature, the recording is automatically paused. The recording is encrypted and cannot be accessed by either the driver or rider, although it is stored locally on the user’s device. Recordings are automatically deleted after 24 hours, so users who intend to report an incident must do so within 24 hours. Customers who want to report a safety issue can do so while referencing the recording. The recording will then be uploaded to Bolt’s internal system to assist in investigations. However, all recordings under investigation will be deleted after seven days unless a Bolt authorised employee extends the retention period. Audio recording adds an extra layer of security Any attempt to improve the safety of riders and drivers on ride-hailing platforms is always welcome. As we pointed out earlier, there’s a real threat of users getting hurt while using these platforms. For starters, an audio recording feature helps with speedy dispute resolution. In cases such as sexual harassment, determining who is at fault can be difficult as the only available proofs are often the words of the concerned parties. That’s a challenge for anyone, and an audio recording feature can be helpful for the ride-hailing platforms and law enforcement agencies. Yahaya Mohammed, Bolt’s Country Manager, says that the retention period for recordings can be extended following a formal request by law enforcement agencies. It could also serve as a deterrent against any unlawful activity. Knowing that the other party can record audio from the trip, riders and drivers act properly because there may be consequences for their actions. It also has the added advantage of boosting users' confidence. Concerns remain over user privacy But while an audio recording adds an extra layer of security for users on these platforms, it also presents questions. The first is about the privacy of the data collected. “Bolt has a robust privacy program in place which includes conducting privacy impact assessments before launching any new feature to ensure that the rights of its users have been properly considered, and that it is acting in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements.” To ensure users are aware of the feature and how it works, Mohammed says the company is raising awareness through social media, email, and blog announcements. Secondly, an audio recording can provide a false sense of security. Where it is evidence in verbal assaults or cases like Adetola's mentioned earlier, it does not protect riders or drivers in the event of a robbery or rape case as victims are unlikely to use their devices due to the traumatic nature of these events. Mohammed adds that the audio recording feature can be combined with other features for maximum effect. “This is just one of a number of features available in our in-app safety toolkit for drivers and riders to use if they’re ever feeling uncomfortable during a ride. We will continue to invest in new products and features that continue to improve the safety ecosystem of our app.” Finally, users are unlikely to think much of it, especially given how ride-hailing companies respond to incidents that happen during rides. Few users who have reported cases while using these apps have gotten any resolution. Often they are referred to law enforcement agencies who give them the run around. In-app audio recording is a step in the right direction to address safety concerns that arise while using ride-hailing platforms. However, its success depends on how well it is combined with other safety features such as proper background checks. Ride-hailing platforms must also provide prompt and effective responses when cases are reported or risk having users disregard the safety measures they put in place.
New startups in Africa's healthcare supply chain sector declined by 81% between 2021 and 2022 – Report Between 2021 and 2022, the number of new startups focusing on Africa’s healthcare supply chain fell by 21%. This is according to a newly released report by Salient Advisory, a healthcare consulting firm. After witnessing a boom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer startups have been founded since then, and the report points out that this decline could be caused by falling demand for digital-first products, a saturation of companies in the space, and a decline in funding for the sector. The report, which surveyed more than 300 healthcare innovators in 27 countries, reveals that 60% of African startups in the supply chain sector are headquartered in Nigeria (24%), South Africa (15%), Kenya (11%), and Egypt (10%). Outside these four countries, 12% of startups in the sector are headquartered in Francophone African countries, while 10% are headquartered outside Africa. Interestingly, most growth-stage and mature companies are headquartered outside Africa. COVID-19 brought a surge in African healthtech innovation, but how viable are the startups now? The healthcare supply chain industry follows a familiar theme of being heavily dominated by male founders, and the report states that only a "few companies founded solely by women exist." Of the surveyed startups, 55% were founded by men, 16% by mixed teams, and only 8% by women. The gender disparity is not limited to the founding teams and extends to funding and company stages. 83% of startups solely founded by women are in the early stages, and 91% of all funding in the sector went to male founding teams. The difficulty female founders encounter when raising funds is also reflected in the funding sources they pursue. 35% of funding raised by women was grants, while debt funding was responsible for 15% of funding. In contrast, only 3% of companies founded by men received grants, while 1% of men raised debt funding. Some of the female founders surveyed for the report disclosed that gender biases made it harder for women to raise capital. In addition to raising less money than their male counterparts, they also reported spending more time on the process. One founder revealed that she had been fundraising since 2021, while another stated that lip service was being paid to the issue of funding women with little done to change the status quo. Although Nigeria and South Africa account for the highest number of companies founded by women, it is startups in East Africa that are responsible for most of the funding. African healthtech startups are combating counterfeit drugs with blockchain, AI The general state of funding in this sub-sector mirrors the overall state of healthcare funding on the continent. Although 41% of the companies featured in the report have raised external funding, two companies – Glovo and Zipline – account for 67% of the total funding raised. When eCommerce and drone delivery companies are excluded, the other companies surveyed for the report have raised $584 million since they were founded. As these companies grow, there’s an increasing appetite for partnerships with governments and private institutions. However, only 8% serve governments or public institutions, with 60% of them being growth-stage companies. These partnerships with government institutions are accompanied by certain challenges. One of these is the slower pace of execution at public institutions. Where startups are more inclined to quick processes, public institutions take their time. The low rate of digital literacy among government institutions is another challenge faced by startups, while funding limits their ability to take on larger projects.
At ₦617 per litre, here are the EV alternatives to petrol in Nigeria In May 2023, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu declared that the era of petrol subsidy was gone and petrol prices in the country went up by as much as 200% — ₦198 to ₦500. Two months later, fuel prices have gone up by another 23% to ₦617. With the annual inflation rate now at 22%, the price of petrol is just one of the many problems Nigerians are facing right now. I contemplated getting a bicycle or becoming a power walker, but my threshold for pain wouldn't permit it. A less painful, but more expensive alternative is electric vehicles (EVs). They are battery-powered, which means they eliminate the cost of petrol. However, the price of EVs is well above what I can afford. A Tesla Model 3 Standard Range, the least expensive Tesla model, goes for $35,000 (₦27.7 million). According to InsideEVs, the only electric vehicles you can get below $20,000 are used. However, price is not the only issue Nigerians have with EVs. Tolu Williams, Founder of Nigerian EV company, Siltech, summarises Nigerians' reservations about EVs: Running out of battery power on the highway Getting electricity to charge the vehicle Repairability and maintenance Electric vehicle for the masses Unlike their foreign counterparts, Nigerian EV manufacturers appear to understand the unique circumstances of car owners in the country. They understand the peculiar nature of road transportation in Nigeria, but can we afford their vehicles, and do they suit our roads and tastes? The three-wheeler EV William's Siltech produces different kinds of electric bikes. From the power-bike-looking ones to off-road types, but he recommends Siltech's 65% made-in-Nigeria three-wheeler — the Falcon. The Falcon retails between ₦650,000 ($837) and ₦700,000 ($900). "EVs are very very expensive," says Williams, "and one of the main reasons is the battery. The battery is 55% to 60% of the EV and it is one of its core components. "EVs are so expensive, an electric bicycle that is up to standard, capable of carrying a grown adult weighing 230 pounds can ride to work and back safely, can set you back over $1,000." With the cost of producing EVs so high, Siltech's decision to assemble their EVs in Nigeria cut production costs by 55% depending on the scale. The Falcon has a range of 300 km. For context, Osun State is 199 km from Ikeja, Lagos. Unlike the Tesla which requires a ₦1.6 million level two or three charger which charges its battery fully within 30 minutes to 3 hours, charging the Falcon is as easy as charging a mobile phone and Williams estimates charging time to be two hours. This is possible because the Falcon uses a significantly smaller battery that doesn't need high-tech chargers. It also uses first-of-its-kind battery swap technology that gives users a fully charged battery in about a minute. The charging time is significantly faster than the Tesla because it has a smaller battery. Who is the Falcon for? Most of the people I asked if they'd be willing to pay ₦700,000 for a three-wheeler and forget about purchasing petrol had safety concerns. But the biggest question was, "What happens when it rains?" It is worth noting that the Falcon is IP67-rated, which means it can survive rain or even get submerged in water. Addressing getting wet in the rain, Williams pointed out that the Falcon has a detachable roof. Williams believes that creating a Tesla-level EV will be costly, especially with support from the government just coming up, so three-wheelers are the perfect starting point for Nigeria. He also explained that "commercial motorcyclists are not our target, we aim to give average Nigerians a cheaper and safer mode of transportation, Most people prefer a three-wheeler because it's self-balanced and easy to ride." The bigger Nigerian EVs Jet Motors does not produce vehicles for personal use, but Wemimo Osanipin (CEO) also says that batteries are a major factor in the cost of EVs. The regular version of the Jet Mover costs ₦27 million ($33,000) but the EV version sells for ₦42 million ($52,546). "If an EV costs ₦20 million, the battery probably costs ₦10 million." Unlike Siltech's three-wheelers, Jet Motors' EVs use way bigger batteries, probably even bigger than a Tesla's, but according to Williams, the chargers required to power those kinds of EVs aren't readily available in Nigeria. "Where there is a will there is a way," Osanipin says about charging these vehicles, "money chases opportunity" and if there's enough need for charging stations, they will be made available. Is there an investment opportunity in Nigeria's EV space? Does Nigeria even have an EV space? Osanipin explains that manufacturers, investors in charging stations, investors in what will power the charging stations, and EV distributors are the four players needed to move Nigeria's EV space forward. But the problem is that these players have no reason to step in if there is no EV market. How do we own EVs when they're too darn expensive? Williams' solution is to assemble the batteries in Nigeria and sell the EVs for less than their current prices. Osanipin believes in another approach. "We have lithium in commercial deposits. Lithium is used for making batteries and batteries are 40% of the cost of making an EV. The federal government should invest in exploration." In 2021 Tesla was willing to explore and mine lithium in Nigeria but they wanted to make the batteries outside the country and sell them to us. That is why Olamilekan Adegbite, Nigeria's Minister of Mines and Steel told Tesla to situate a battery-making factory in Nigeria when the carmaker requested to mine lithium from Nigeria. We've not heard from Tesla since, so I guess they weren't down with the deal. However, the government is waiting for foreign companies to develop its EV industry. The National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) just purchased Jet EVs, a move Osanipin sees as the government's willingness to invest in EVs. The NADDC also worked with Jet Motors to draft a national plan for the development of electric vehicles in Nigeria. Electric scooter solution? At this point, people are either too scared to ride the Falcon or not rich enough to get a Jet EV, but there's one last option — an electric scooter. You're probably wondering how this is even a solution. I thought the same thing until I spoke to Isaac Oyedokun, the Founder of Trekk, an e-mobility startup that uses electric scooters to transport people within closed communities. Here's how Trekk works. You download the Trekk app, locate a Trekk scooter with the app, scan the QR code on the scooter, pay to unlock, and ride off into the sunset. However, the downside is that it is limited to a certain group of users such as students or people who commute within a small community. "To guard against theft and the safety of our riders, every community is geofenced to limit riders from going out of our communities." Oyedokun says the scooter is currently available in some Nigerian universities such as Lagos State University, and Pan-Atlantic University. With ₦10 charge per minute and ₦20 to unlock, the scooter sounds like a good deal, but EV manufacturers in Nigeria do not have an EV solution for most Nigerians. From a lack of funding to the absence of government support, there is a lot that stands in the way of mainstream EV usage in Nigeria. Tesla's position in the global EV market today would not have been possible without over $20 billion in investments. Noteworthy also is the fact that all companies owned by its CEO, Elon Musk, have enjoyed more than $4 billion in government subsidies. Tesla has a deal with the American government to hire people and improve its product while it is sales tax-free for the next 20 years. The US government incentivises consumers and producers in the EV market; people who buy the vehicles get a $7,500 tax credit. Interestingly, EVs accounted for only 5.8% of car sales in the US in 2022. While this figure might seem small, it is an improvement from 3.1% the year before. The EV market is growing globally and for Africa not to be left behind, its governments need to make the industry attractive for investors. Or perhaps we just wait for the Westerners to perfect the market and we leapfrog the innovation stage. I vote for the former.
4 Africa-focused crypto exchanges that have shut down since the FTX debacle of 2022 Key takeaways: The number of Africa-focused crypto exchanges that have shut down continues to grow, with Bundle Africa being the latest addition. The prolonged crypto winter has been unkind to many crypto businesses globally. Funding in 2022 and 2023 has gotten progressively worse compared to 2021. Besides the crypto winter, some exchanges have shut down due to regulatory hurdles, scams, and mounting losses. Since the fall of the $32 billion crypto exchange, FTX, the crypto market has taken a turn for the worse. The excitement around get-rich-quick digital tokens has waned over the past eight months. Crypto news barely makes headlines anymore, and stories of people making billions from meme coins are nowhere to be seen, leaving crypto evangelists with nothing to arm themselves with when they try to win souls for the ecosystem. Even investors are weary of the market. The crypto market was bullish in 2021 and investors took advantage. Total funding was valued at $37.06 billion. But by 2022, the story changed big time, funding dropped by $16 billion to $21.26 billion. Like the rest of the world, crypto tales in Africa are also in gloomy chapters. Crypto exchanges focused on African users have shut down, unable to survive the harsh crypto winter and regulatory hurdles that plague crypto businesses globally. In this article, we list Africa-focused crypto exchanges that have shut down since FTX's untimely death in November 2022. Africa-focused crypto exchanges that have shut down LocalBitcoins LocalBitcoins shut down in February 2023 after 10 years of operation. It is one of the earliest and most popular peer-to-peer platforms in the crypto ecosystem. In its announcement, LocalBitcoins said, "Regardless of our efforts to overcome challenges during the ongoing very cold crypto-winter, we have regretfully concluded that LocalBitcoins can no longer provide its Bitcoin trading service." Paxful Paxful, a US-based crypto exchange, shut down its operations in April 2023, with the CEO, Ray Youseff citing the closure on an unfavourable regulatory landscape. Interestingly, the company announced that it was back online one month later. Per CoinDesk, Paxful is currently owned by a custodian, who serves as a director. Bundle Africa Bundle Africa is the latest exchange to close its doors to users. It announced it was shutting down exchange operations in July 2023, to focus on its P2P product, Cashlink. While the company did not site regulatory hurdles or crypto winter has one of the reasons for the shutdown, it is not out of place to presume that might be the case. LocalCyptos Local cryptos shut down in October 2022, a month before the FTX collapse, but it is a worthy mention in the list of Africa-focused crypto exchanges that have collapsed. LocalCryptos launched in October 2017 and amassed 400,000 users before it shut down five years later. Its main reasons for closing up shop are the crypto winter and the regulatory landscape. The crypto landscape is unpredictable and no one knows how much longer the crypto winter will last, but at this rate, more crypto businesses will die out in the cold if the bulls don't rally soon.
CBN increases benchmark interest rate Google is rolling out several new features to help users find relevant results when searching for women's sports.

The tech giant has also teamed up with broadcasters and rights holders to make live streams and highlights easily accessible from the Search results page. Google says its systems are considering more tournament-related searches and other factors to understand better what users are looking for. This will allow the company to display information about women's leagues and popular events. Here's what I've got for you today: Techpoint Africa unveils the Modern Workplace Africa CBN increases benchmark interest rate Boya partners Visa and Diamond Trust Bank Techpoint Africa unveils the Modern Workplace Africa Remember when ChatGPT launched, sparking debates about whether AI would replace us and our jobs? Tech giants responded to the launch by releasing their AI-powered products, such as Bing and Bard, impacting how we work. So you can agree with me that in our rapidly changing world of technology and innovation, we can not ignore the topic of the future of work. In light of this, Techpoint Africa is excited to unveil its latest groundbreaking event, Modern Workplace Africa! We would talk about several topics, including how emerging technologies like AI will shape our careers, what the rise of the gig economy means for professionals and businesses, and how workers are navigating the ever-changing work landscape.

For more information, check out Victor’s post here: Come navigate the digital work landscape at the Modern Workplace Africa CBN increases benchmark interest rate The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has now increased the benchmark interest rate — monetary policy rate (MPR) — by 25 basis points to 18.75% from 18.5%. What does the MPR mean? A benchmark interest rate determines the amount of other interest rates. It is the basis for all types of financial agreements, such as mortgages, bank overdrafts, and other more intricate financial dealings. In other words, it is the rate at which banks decide how much you will pay to borrow from them. The higher the benchmark rate, the more expensive it is to borrow money. Why the increase? The MPC says the country's rising inflation rate is the primary factor. Nigeria's overall inflation rate spiked to 22.79% in June 2023. This is still the case despite several interest rate increases by the CBN over the past 14 months. For context, before the end of the Buhari-led administration, the former CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, raised rates three times in response to inflation in 2023. Since the CBN adopted a hawkish stance in May 2022, the interest rate has increased by 725 basis points, from 11.5% to 18.75%, while inflation has risen from 17.71% to 22.79%. Expectedly, the removal of fuel subsidies and the convergence of the exchange rate will further increase inflation.Folashodun Shonubi, the acting CBN Governor, says the increase in interest rates will promote foreign investment and help to lower the negative real rate of returns. Boya partners Visa and Diamond Trust Bank Kenyan fintech startup, Boya, has partnered with Visa and Diamond Trust Bank (DTB) to unveil its virtual Visa expense card for small businesses to manage payments and expenses. The Boya platform simplifies and automates expense management processes, including revolutionising expense tracking and reporting for businesses of all sizes. This collaboration could enable businesses to manage expenses easily, improve financial visibility, and save money. Boya has integrated DTB Cards into its platform, providing users with access to virtual corporate cards, which is supported by the Visa card programme. These virtual corporate cards simplify financial processes and promote financial transparency by allowing businesses to track, manage, and reconcile business expenses.

Mastercard partners Alerzo, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce platform, to digitise SMEs Global payments giant, Mastercard, has partnered with Alerzo, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce platform, to empower Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by offering digital payment solutions, financial education, and credit access. This partnership plans to accelerate the adoption of digital payments and promote the use of financial solutions over the next five years. It also aims to provide practical financial training and knowledge to one million Nigerian SMEs. Alerzo's background in B2B eCommerce and Mastercard's extensive global infrastructure and network will make it simpler for companies of all sizes to access digital payments. Additionally, businesses will have access to several solutions, such as VeedezPay, a digital payment solution created specifically for small and independent companies. These SMEs will also access VeedezPro, a comprehensive business management tool, and Enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions for larger, more established companies. Moreover, the low-cost acceptance solutions offered by the partnership, such as Tap on Phone, QR, Pay-By-Link, and Payment Gateway Service, will be helpful to SMEs and informal retailers. Businesses can sign up for VeedezPay and VeedezPro, available for download from the App Store and Google Play, to accept digital and contactless payments. Established businesses can also access the ERP solution, which includes integrated business management tools and several other features. Business owners who use the VeedezPay and VeedezPro solutions will also have access to micro-lending services. One report found that only 15% of Nigerian SMEs have access to formal credit, leaving many SMEs with insufficient funding. Besides, another report shows that the financing gap for Nigeria's micro, small, and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) has reached $158.1 billion. Director-General of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), Olawale Fasanya, said access to capital is one of the biggest obstacles to the growth of MSMEs. Thus, the Alerzo B2B commerce application will provide informal retailers with access to micro-lending options. What's more, Alerzo digitises commerce and payments processes between Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) suppliers and informal retailers. It claims it serves over 100,000 retailers. "With our combined expertise and resources, we look forward to continuing to provide training, financial support, and innovative payment solutions to businesses in Nigeria. These solutions could be a game-changer, especially for our informal retailers, who often get overlooked," Adewale Opaleye, Alerzo CEO, says.
Nigerian healthtech startup, Clafiya, raises $610,000 in pre-seed funding to fuel expansion Nigerian healthtech startup, Clafiya, has disclosed $610,000 in pre-seed funding to fuel its expansion, invest in product development, and hire fresh tech talent. The funding comes from venture capital funds, angel investments, and grants. Norrsken Accelerator, Acquired Wisdom Fund (AWF), Hustle Fund, Voltron Capital, Microtraction, Ajim Capital, HoaQ, Bold Angel Fund, Shivdasani Family, and several angel investors participated in the round. This news follows Clafiya's acceptance into the Google Black Founders Fund in 2022. Launched in 2021 by Jennie Nwokoye, Clafiya provides virtual and in-patient care services to maintain control over the value chain and the standard of care delivered. Clafiya offers consultation, health education, rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and typhoid, STD testing, and screening for hypertension, diabetes, or blood sugar. It also provides in-person maternity care testing. Besides, it provides care navigation and refers patients to different healthcare facilities. It also targets small and medium businesses, where employers provide services for their staff by offering health care to them. These employees can also register their families, providing health insurance to them. Clafiya offers in-patient visits and virtual consultations, changing how Nigerians access healthcare When the company launched, its primary goal was to make healthcare more convenient for people by putting them in touch with vetted medical professionals. However, Nwokoye says the startup has adjusted its strategy as it continues to engage with its users and the market. Thus, Clafiya is developing a digital primary care facility focused on the patient as the beneficiary while collaborating with pharmacies, diagnostic facilities, mental health services, hospitals, and health specialists to provide an all-encompassing healthcare experience. It is also launching its B2B offering, which allows businesses to set up health savings accounts through which their employees can access primary healthcare. What’s more, the healthtech startup also provides products that allow people living abroad to purchase healthcare plans for relatives in Nigeria rather than sending money directly.
Clafiya offers in-patient visits and virtual consultations, changing how Nigerians access healthcare In 2000, Jennie Nwokoye, the founder of a Nigerian healthtech startup, Clafiya, moved to Nigeria with her family when as a child. For someone born and raised in the United States, that was the first time she encountered difficulty accessing basic healthcare. She and her family stayed in the country for five to six years before moving back to the United States. As an adult, she returned to Nigeria every year and noticed that the problem — limited access to healthcare — remained unsolved. So, as a graduate student specialising in systems engineering at Georgetown University, United States, in 2018, she began developing the concept of Clafiya. "When I was accepted to Georgetown, our first class was like an introduction to systems engineering, and then we had to choose a complex system to write about. And I consider Nigeria's healthcare system complex, particularly its primary healthcare," Nwokoye explains. That was how she began writing about Clafiya from an academic standpoint. Until her professors told her to make something out of it, she didn't give it much thought because Clafiya was just a topic of interest to her. “I got a lot of support from my professors. They also encouraged me to pitch at Georgetown. So, I participated in pitch competitions around Georgetown. And I won some money here and there. And I realised I could bring it to life," Nwokoye says. Even as a graduate student, Nwokoye claims she would travel to Nigeria to talk to locals to understand the culture and spend time conducting customer discovery because she didn’t have enough lived experience in Nigeria. It wasn't until 2021 that she created the MVP for Clafiya while working with Amazon. She left the eCommerce giant in the same year to focus on Clafiya. "Building a startup in Africa, particularly Nigeria, is hard. And it's harder for black women. However, what is rewarding about this experience is the impact we can have on our customers' lives and the lessons we can learn from the market to continue to develop and grow,” Nwokoye says. In addition to her background in systems engineering, she has the grit and passion to solve customers' pain points. How Clafiya is making healthcare accessible Clafiya, which means "community wellness", is on a mission to promote healthy communities throughout Africa and the rest of the world, starting with Nigeria. For context, Clafiya is a combination of two words: community and lafiya, a Hausa word for wellness. Hausa is a language spoken in Northern Nigeria. The company offers hybrid primary care services to maintain control over the value chain and the quality of care provided. Anyone can register on its platform and sign up for its service. It also targets small and medium businesses, where employers provide services for their staff by offering health care to them. These employees can also register their families, providing health insurance to them. Obtaining health insurance is mandatory in Nigeria; here is how to get it "It's like an Uber model in that you sign up, schedule an appointment, and we send the nearest healthcare practitioner to you. So, a nurse or community health officer will come to you to provide in-person primary care," Nwokoye says. Patients can pay ₦‎5,000 ($10.86) to receive in-person care while communicating with doctors virtually via video call. "So you've got two people with you during your consultation. You have your nurse or community health officer in person, and your doctor is there virtually,” she emphasises. Additionally, patients can receive health care without an in-person visit if they only want a virtual consultation. This costs ₦‎2,500 ($5.43). Clafiya offers consultation, health education, rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and typhoid, STD testing, and screening for hypertension, diabetes, or blood sugar. It also provides in-person maternity care testing. Besides, it provides care navigation and refers patients to different healthcare facilities. According to Nwokoye, "This part is cool because our partnerships with them entail you getting priority treatment. Because you've already received primary care, all you need now is secondary or tertiary care from the referred hospital.” For instance, if you received primary care from Clafiya but later decided you needed more specialised care, the company may refer you to one of its partner hospitals, where Nwokoye claims there will be no waiting period. Clafiya also partners with pharmacies and other healthtech companies that can deliver medications to users on request. The startup collaborates with other healthtech startups to collect samples from users' homes or workplaces for analysis in a lab. It also refers them to one of its local partners if they require in-person screening. Clafiya works with platforms that use technology to support mental health and provides therapy or consultation services. Although partners set the prices for their offerings, Nwokoye says they’re discounted fees. These services are available through Clafiya's website or the USSD code *347*58#. The company is currently working on a mobile app, which will be available in the fourth quarter of 2023. Leveraging community health despite challenges Clafiya claims to be the first in Nigeria to combine telemedicine and in-person visits though some healthtech startups focus on the former. It is common for rural populations to travel great distances to access healthcare services, especially subspecialist services, but Clafiya is changing this trend through its USSD feature. In addition, urban residents can use the USSD code to request home visits from doctors if they can’t easily access healthcare due to hospital wait times. With its USSD feature, users can access healthcare from their homes whether they have a smartphone or not. While Nigeria has a population of over 200 million people, Statista shows that there are currently between 25 and 40 million smartphone users in Nigeria. Consequently, the startup distinguishes itself by providing health care via its USSD, removing barriers to accessing healthcare in Nigeria. Clafiya has received funding from VCs, such as Microtraction, and has participated in the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund 2022 and Norrsken Impact Accelerator 2022. Clafiya works with over 100 businesses and has 2,000 registered users. The company is looking to grow its user base to 5,000 by the end of 2023. One of the challenges it faces is uncertainty about the regulations governing the operation of healthtech startups in Nigeria. Additionally, due to the high doctor-emigration rate among healthcare professionals, Clafiya relies on nurses or community health officers to deliver some “level of care.” "Brain drain is a problem. That's why we're utilising nurses and community health officers who are also the cornerstones of health in our communities but underutilised or underpaid,” Nwokoye says. African healthtech startups can’t solve the continent’s rising healthcare worker emigration problem, but they can mitigate it Finding the right talent is another challenge, as is putting the necessary infrastructure in place, including a reliable Internet connection, power supply, and traffic congestion that makes it difficult to reach customers on time. Nwokoye claims that overcoming these challenges makes the startup journey exciting because "that's where we experience our creative and innovative ways of getting things done in Nigeria." With 22 employees as of publication time, Nwokoye is enthusiastic about her co-workers because they are intelligent and passionate about the issue they are tackling. Clafiya is currently developing a beta version of its product for businesses. "We are building a product that allows SMEs to provide affordable, convenient, quality primary care services with flexible payment options for their employees," Nwokoye says. Even though the startup is only in Lagos and Enugu States now, it plans to be in every state in Nigeria. "With our virtual platform, we can technically [be in every Nigerian state.] However, it will take time for that in-person care that our patients love to spread to other regions of Nigeria,” Nwokoye concludes.
South Africa's Investigating Unit wants clarity on state institution after losing court case Jumia Food has announced its expansion into Meru and Nanyuki, broadening its presence in Kenya’s smaller cities. Customers can now order their preferred KFC meals from the convenience of their homes in Meru and Nanyuki. Jumia Food is already available in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, and Nakuru, with plans to expand into additional secondary cities in the coming months. Here's what I've got for you today: South Africa's investigating unit wants clarity on Telkom-Ramphosa case FCCPC to impose up to ₦‎10 million fines on PoS operators TikTok introduces text posts South Africa's investigating unit wants clarity on Telkom-Ramphosa case. Remember this? Telkom wins court case against South African President Well, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is now considering its legal options in light of the Pretoria High Court's decision invalidating its ability to probe Telkom's affairs. The unit states the court found Telkom is not a “state institution” and could not investigate its affairs. Now it needs clarification on what that judgment means. Why? The unit says clarifying what constitutes a state institution is crucial and will strengthen its efforts to root out corruption and poor management in the operation of all state institutions. “In terms of the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act 74 0f 1996, the SIU is empowered to investigate allegations of corruption and maladministration in the affairs of state institutions like government departments, municipalities and state-owned entities; to recover financial losses suffered by the state and prevent further losses,” the unit says. It also contends that there are grounds for an appeal and that a higher court should decide on and resolve the matter of the state institution. If this is not made clear, it could set an unfavourable precedent where some public institutions might unintentionally be exempt from the SIU's investigation. Last week, Telkom triumphed in its legal battle with President Cyril Ramaphosa over his order authorising the SIU to investigate any possible wrongdoing in the telco's assets’ sales. FCCPC to impose up to ₦‎10 million fines on PoS operators The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has threatened to impose fines of up to ₦‎10 million on Point of Sale operators who disobey its order regarding the proposed increase in PoS charges. The FCCPC states that each PoS operator is free to raise prices as they see fit to generate a profit from their business. It claims, however, that the Association of Mobile Money and Bank Agents in Nigeria (AMMBAN) is not permitted by law to set prices for its members. In June 2023, the AMMBAN, Lagos Chapter, released a revised PoS price list, stating that the increase reflects the current economic climate in the country. Early in July, the FCCPC warned AMMBAN, its members, and PoS operators, urging them not to engage in price-fixing or change the costs of their services. The association began implementing its new prices on July 17, 2023, despite getting kickbacks from several stakeholders. So, the Commission says PoS operators disobeying its order could pay fines of up to ₦10,000,000 for corporate entities and up to ₦1,000,000 and/or a three-month prison sentence for individuals. Additionally, despite the Commission's preference to avoid interfering with small businesses' operations, Babatunde Irukera, CEO of the FCCPC, asserts that the Commission will — if necessary — deny merchant services and privileges to PoS operators or AMMBAN members who persist in behaviour that is incompatible with the law and economic efficiency. TikTok introduces text posts TikTok is introducing text posts to compete with Twitter — now X — and Threads. The social media platform says the new content option will give creators another means of self-expression by enabling them to share their stories, poems, lyrics, and other written content. TikTok began as a platform for short-form video but later added image support to compete with Instagram. How do you use the new feature? You can select from three options on the Camera page of the app: photo, video, and text to post on TikTok. When you choose the text option, a page where you can enter the text for your post will be displayed. Then you can edit your text by including sounds, tagging a location, turning on comments, and activating Duets. Along with tags and hashtags, you can add stickers to text posts. Several background colours are also available for selection. You can save your drafts and keep them with other unpublished posts for later editing, just like with video or photo posts, or you can delete them entirely. TikTok's decision to include text posts at this time is not surprising. Remember when Threads launched? Meta's microblogging platform also took advantage of Twitter's questionable decisions and limitations on non-paying users. TikTok most likely wants to give users another option for posting text-based content. However, the appearance of text posts on the app may discourage people from using them in the same way they use Twitter.

How Tradecurve (TCRV) Is Surpassing Aptos (APT) and Ethereum (ETH) in Growth Rate The investors favor crypto projects that add value to the industry. A new project, Tradecurve, is one such project that has multiple utilities and solves complex real-world problems. Even the growth rate of Aptos (APT) and Ethereum (ETH) seem smaller when compared with the rise of Tradecurve (TCRV). While all crypto projects aim to make a big impact on the market, only a few of them are able to do so. Considering its growth prospect, whales have been pouring money into its ongoing presale round. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<< Aptos (APT) Becomes 9th Most-Tweeted Crypto Project The first quarter of 2023 has been beneficial for Aptos (APT), barring the month of March. While Aptos was able to soar by about 400% in January, it forged many new strategic partnerships in February. Aptos was also able to record its all-time high of $19.90 in January. However, bears suppressed Aptos in March, and the token lost about 48% value from its ATH. Currently, Aptos is changing hands at $10.26, with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion. In the meantime, Streamr has ranked Aptos 9th on the list of most-tweeted cryptocurrencies. According to experts, the ranking is a sign of investors’ confidence in Aptos (APT), which has increased in the past three months. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<< Whales Increase Their Ethereum (ETH) Accumulation Ethereum (ETH) launched Shanghai Upgrade on its mainnet in April. Since it was one of the most-awaited developments of this year, the market sentiments around Ethereum have become bullish after the launch of the Shanghai Upgrade. However, the market value of Ethereum has plunged by 12% in the past week. Ethereum has risen by 2% on the monthly chart. According to the latest data from Santiment, whales have increased their Ethereum accumulation by 0.5% in recent weeks. Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade has enabled users to withdraw their staked Ethereum. Currently, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,854.82. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<< Tradecurve (TCRV) Becomes the Market Star of 2023 There are thousands of trading exchanges in the world, but all of them are tunnel-visioned. For instance, exchanges like Binance and Huobi are limited to cryptocurrency-related assets, while platforms like Upstox and Webull restrict their users to traditional derivatives. However, the entry of Tradecurve (TCRV) has changed the entire landscape. It is a first-of-its-kind platform that allows the trading of a wide range of assets, including cryptocurrency, Forex, stocks, bonds, OTC derivatives, and ETFs without FIAT payments. Since the crypto market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.8% from 2021 to 2030, experts believe that Tradecurve has massive growth potential. The USP of this platform is that traders hold their own keys, and control their own assets, unlike established projects like Coinbase. It also protects users’ privacy through DeFi capabilities. TCRV token owners will be given bonuses on their trades, discounts on trading fees, and subscription fees for using AI trading bots. Its presale phase has begun, and is currently in stage 1. TCRV tokens are currently available to purchase at $0.018. Since only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be supplied during the presale phase, bulls have pounced on the project to get the maximum benefits.
African crypto exchange, Bundle Africa shuts down operations to focus on P2P payments The news: African crypto exchange, Bundle Africa, has shut down operations after three years of operation. It says it'll now focus on expanding Cashlink, its peer-to-peer (P2P) payment network. The company has amassed 50,000 monthly active users over the years and $50 million in monthly transactions. After three years of operation, Bundle Africa is closing its doors to users. According to a blog post on the Bundle Africa website, the company wants to focus on Cashlink, its P2P payment network, to meet the payment needs of the growing Web3 and blockchain community. It also revealed that in Bundle's three years, it had amassed 50,000 monthly active users, 3 million transactions, and $50 million monthly volume. Founded in 2020 by Yele Bademosi and Emmanuel Babalola, Bundle Africa was launched as a social payment app for cash or crypto. "Bundle’s mission is to create a world where all Africans regardless of their geographical location, have access to the best, open and inclusive financial services that will improve the quality of their lives and help them achieve their personal goals," Bademosi told Techpoint Africa in 2020. Former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi launches 'Bundle', to unify traditional fintech and open finance Cashlink launched as a P2P infrastructure that helps users on-ramp and off-ramp Web3 platforms. It essentially helps users enter and exit the crypto ecosystem with fiat. Bundle Africa CEO, Emmanuel Babalola said Cashlink was created to be "the Uber for money." With 1.7 million in processed transactions in its first year, Cashlink is already growing fast. It will also be used by Nigerian and Ghanaian Bundle Africa users in withdrawing their funds as buying, selling, and withdrawals on Bundle Africa has been ceased. Bundle Africa joins the league of crypto exchanges that have shut down operations since the FTX collapse of 2022. And as the crypto winter lingers, one begins to wonder, which exchange will make it out alive?
Advocacy group sues the Central Bank of Nigeria It’s salary week; are you happy? Are you even happy that it's a new day or week? I’m asking because lately, I don’t know if happiness is supposed to be constant or fluid. Are you happy when you satisfy a craving or get something you want? Or is it a state you delude yourself into even if your brain does not produce the chemicals that make you happy? What does happiness mean to you? Are you supposed to be happy or feel happy? Please excuse me. This occurs when you are attempting to think of an introduction. Intros are hard to write, but happiness shouldn’t be that hard for the limbic cortex — the part of your brain responsible for that— to produce, yeah? So, whatever your situation, know that you are not alone. It is okay to experience negative emotions, but please stay positive this week. Stay happy! Here's what I've got for you today: Advocacy group sues the Central Bank of Nigeria Flutterwave's funds to remain frozen in Kenya Kasha's $21m Series B Twitter might change its logo to X today Advocacy group sues CBN Last Friday, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) sued the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for failing to withdraw its regulation requiring financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, to obtain their customers' social media handles. In the lawsuit with case number FHC/L/CS/1410/2023 filed at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is also asking for an order preventing the CBN from carrying out or giving effect to the unlawful provisions of the regulation. This move came just a month after the advocacy group gave the central bank a three-day deadline to withdraw the regulation or risk legal repercussions. The advocacy group claimed that requiring customers to provide their social media handles or addresses serves no legitimate purpose. Why? Because using this information could arbitrarily or unjustifiably restrict rights to privacy and free expression. Such information could be obtained and used for illegal, political, and other purposes. For now, the hearing for the lawsuit has not yet been scheduled. Flutterwave's funds to remain frozen in Kenya A Kenyan judge has dismissed Kenya’s anti-graft agency’s — Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) — request to dismiss its lawsuit against Flutterwave. Given that the agency had provided the court with proof of Flutterwave's wrongdoing, Judge Nixon Sifuna of the High Court in Nairobi questioned the agency's decision to dismiss the case. For context, in a court document dated July 20, 2023, the judge said the ARA gave the court several documents proving that the millions of dollars in Flutterwave’s account were illegally obtained. Consequently, he said the case will not be dismissed and Flutterwave accounts will remain frozen until the CEO of ARA or a senior official swears an affidavit saying there is insufficient evidence against the payments company. In August 2022, a Kenyan court froze KSh 400.6 million ($3.3 million) in Flutterwave's accounts due to allegations of money laundering and card fraud for the second time that year. The court granted the ARA's request to prevent Flutterwave from transferring or withdrawing funds from three bank accounts — two in United Bank for Africa (UBA) and one in Access Bank — and 19 Safaricom M-Pesa paybill numbers. The ARA first applied to have Flutterwave's accounts frozen in July 2023. That first case saw KSh 6.2 billion ($52.5 million) spread across 62 bank accounts locked until February 2023, when the agency withdrew its case. Kasha's $21m Series B Rwandan online retail platform, Kasha, announced $21 million in Series B funding last week. Knife Capital led the round, with participation from several investors, including FinnFund, DFC, and Beyond Capital Ventures. Currently operating in Kenya and Rwanda, the company intends to use the funds to accelerate its growth and expand to South Africa — where it has already registered — and West Africa later in 2023. Founded in 2016 by Joanna Bichsel (CEO), Kasha is a digital retail and last-mile distribution platform for medications and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs), focusing on women's healthcare needs and household goods. Its customers, including individual consumers, small resellers, hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics, can order products ranging from sanitary pads and contraceptives to diapers and cleaning supplies via its website or USSD. Kasha reaches out to the last mile of the mass market customer in addition to expanding its distribution network and giving inventory credit to pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals. The startup sources and stocks the products it sells to customers, resellers, and clinics directly from manufacturers and suppliers to guarantee their products are genuine. Kasha also plans to aggressively expand its customer base, go global, provide investors with a high rate of return, and ultimately go public. Twitter might change its logo to X today Elon Musk claimed that the Twitter bird logo might be changed to an "X" today. In April 2023, Twitter Inc. ceased to be a standalone business when it merged with X Corp., a recently established shell company. The microblogging platform is now part of Musk's X Holdings, billed as the future parent company for all his ventures, including Neuralink, SpaceX, Tesla, and The Boring Company. The name change reflects his vision of creating "X, the everything app," similar to China's WeChat, which performs social media and payment functions. So, if the rebranding moves forward, it will be the latest instance of Musk's propensity to announce significant and divisive changes to the site on his public feed, seemingly on the fly and to varying degrees of success. The 2006-founded company, Twitter, whose name is a play on the sound of birds chirping, has used avian branding since its inception. The company reportedly paid $15 for a stock symbol depicting a light blue bird.

Serial entrepreneur, Victor Fatanmi, shares how founders can benefit from building in public In 2020, author and podcaster, David Perell, published an article outlining a ten-year plan for his online writing course, Write of Passage. He revealed some of the products the company planned to launch and the steps it would take to achieve those milestones. That's one example of a phenomenon that has been gaining ground in business circles; building in public. Whereas businesses previously spent months secretly working on a product before announcing it with a big launch, proponents for building in public now provide behind-the-scenes looks at product development, getting real-time user feedback in the process. Victor Fatanmi is another example of building in public. In April 2023, along with his co-founders, he launched Fullgap, which they dubbed "an operating system for creatives". Armed with Twitter, and a good bit of storytelling, Fatanmi has all but singlehandedly led marketing efforts for the startup since inception. The result? Over 4000 users, managing 400+ projects valued at over $100,000, according to a recent tweet Fatanmi sent out. Before Fullgap, Fatanmi co-founded, and still leads design agency, FourthCanvas, which wasn't built in public per se. Either way, he should know a thing or two about building in public. The two-time CEO shares his thoughts on building in public and strategies available to startup founders. What should founders share? For Fatanmi, building in public is "carrying the public along with what you are trying to do, and seeking their feedback along the way, even when it's not yet ready." The degree to which founders share is dependent on their business and the sensitivity of the data in question. While sharing certain information about a business may not be wrong, the timing could hurt the business or skew public perception. "Not everything should be shared, but we also hide much more than we need to hide in this part of the world where nobody talks about their salaries. The people who did it the last time were shouted down. When you're trying to analyse what to share, ensure you're not acting out of uninvestigated fear." For example, information that could hurt a startup's investors, its ability to raise capital, or data that competitors can use against the startup can be left out. However, some information that founders choose to leave out at a certain time could be revealed much later. Benefits of building in public The Internet has caused huge lifestyle changes; where we could only get news from newspapers and television, we can now access hundreds of news publications and large audiences with a smartphone. Away from startup founders, individuals already share their journeys through challenges like 100 Days of Code or 100 Days of Design. Most people want to hold themselves accountable and ensure they remain committed, but for founders, the benefits of building in public often differ. One benefit Fatanmi identifies is its effect on marketing a business. The average social media user is bombarded with ads from individuals and businesses daily, making it harder to get a user's attention. Consequently, many businesses opt for influencer marketing as an organic means of grabbing attention. Fatanmi believes founders can also generate similar results by sharing their processes and progress with their audience. "One of the biggest changes we've seen behaviourally, especially with Gen Zs, is that people are very cynical. There's this sense that we've seen this before, and people now spot ads faster than before, so the more organic your approach is, the more effective it is. Building in public makes marketing your product easier because people feel they were a part of the process." It also makes it easier for investors to discover and consider funding startups. Venture capitalists frequently discover portfolio companies through friends or fellow VCs, and by sharing your process, you could put yourself in front of potential investors. Building in public is also crucial for attracting talent. By sharing the projects you're working on and what it feels like to work on them, you give a glimpse of your work culture, an increasingly important metric for employees. How to build in public Running a business is hard enough without adding extra responsibilities. Fatanmi admits that building in public is not for all founders. "Storytelling or building in public is just one approach. Of course, those of us who believe in it will argue for it, but it's not as absolute as having a good product." He advises founders who choose to build in public to delegate tasks. This could take the form of splitting responsibilities with co-founders, hiring senior executives for specific business functions, or having employees craft messages for social media or any other medium. The channel founders choose is up to them, but Fatanmi prefers Twitter because of its informal tone. "LinkedIn feels like morning stand-up, and Twitter feels like lunch break." With many founders writing articles on platforms like Medium or Substack, he cautions that they need to go beyond dropping links on social media. Rather, they should repurpose the content for social media, while including a link for people willing to read longer pieces. "The whole idea is that it's not been so effective telling people nothing and asking them to go elsewhere. On every platform, we need to say something as opposed to redirecting them to another platform." With users likely to give their opinions on a product's direction, founders should receive feedback as they would if they were not building in public. "Appreciate every feedback, consider every feedback, and then accept the ones that you think make sense, but let everyone know that their feedback is received and considered. If there's a clear reason why you would not take a recommendation, you should communicate it." On remaining transparent throughout the process, he points out that while founders ultimately choose what they work on, staying open about the process ensures they get all the benefits of building in public.
Telkom wins court case against South African President How are you doing today? How was your week? When people enquire about my well-being, I wonder whether they do so out of courtesy. Anyway, I'm trying to understand that most people do not care and that’s fine. However, I do care, so I want to know. Talking is therapeutic. So, click the reply button and tell me how you feel. Plus, whatever plans you have for the weekend, include time for reflection and meditation. I won't tell you to exercise because I haven’t done so since Saturday. But you know what to do, right? Finally, on this week's episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discusses several stories, including Uber and Bolt launching audio recording safety options and Nigeria's advertising council going after Mr Macaroni. Listen here. Here's what I've got for you today: Telkom wins court case against South African President Netflix cracks down on password sharing in South Africa Google is testing a new AI tool for journalists Telkom wins court case against South African President Telkom has won a court case against South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa. What happened? Ramaphosa directed the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to look into Telkom's mismanagement of the sale of iWayAfrica and Africa Online Mauritius and the sale of Multi-Links telecommunications — a failed company it had acquired in Nigeria in 2006. He also ordered an investigation into the procurement of telegraph services (telex and telegrams). This resulted in the South African telco losing millions of rands in shareholder value. The South African government owns 40.5% of the JSE-listed Telkom, while the Public Investment Corporation, another state-owned company with strong ties to the South African government, hold 14.8%. In June 2022, Chris Teurlinckx, Telkom's Acting Group Executive for Legal Services, said Ramaphosa acted unlawfully in instructing the SIU to investigate allegations of misconduct dating back to 2006. Consequently, in July 2022, the South African telco petitioned the Pretoria High Court to rule Ramaphosa's decision to order the investigation into alleged misconduct at Telkom unconstitutional and invalid. What now? The telco claims that Proclamation 49, issued by the president of South Africa on January 25, 2022, granting the authority to investigate Telkom, has been overturned by the Pretoria High Court. Serame Taukobong, Telkom Group CEO, stated that the company had already addressed the claims in the proclamation through Telkom's corporate governance processes, and the results are public record. Telkom reportedly approached the courts because it believed that if the proclamation went unchallenged, it would set a dangerous precedent regarding the role of the state in private enterprise. According to the ruling, Judge J. Thlapi determined that the proclamation's issuance was unconstitutional, invalid, and of no force or effect. Netflix cracks down on password sharing in South Africa Netflix has begun to take action against password sharing and will no longer provide a discounted option for adding additional users to accounts in South Africa. The streaming giant uses a combination of IP addresses, device IDs, and “account activity from devices signed into the Netflix account” to determine if an account is being used in the primary account holder’s household. If it finds that someone else is using the account in another location, it sends the user a notification asking them to set their primary location. When it started limiting accounts to single households, Netflix's revenue increased in every region, and new sign-ups outnumbered cancellations. The company said it introduced paid sharing to more than 100 nations in May 2023, accounting for over 80% of its earnings. Consequently, between April 2023 and June 2023, the streaming service added 5.9 million paying subscribers. Besides, Netflix reported $8.18 billion in revenue and an operating profit of $1.8 billion, which it claims was generally in line with expectations. The company anticipates revenue growth to increase in the second half of the year as paid sharing fully pays off and the ad-supported plan continues to grow steadily. Netflix plans to have an operating margin of 18% to 20% in 2023. Google is testing a new AI tool for journalists Every three market days — pardon my exaggeration — we hear of a new AI tool replacing helping writers, engineers, and other workers become more productive. Since launching Bard — a ChatGPT challenger — in March 2023, Google is reportedly working on an AI tool that can generate article text and headlines for reporters. The product, dubbed Genesis, employs AI to take in data, such as specifics of current events, and then produce news stories. The New York Times claimed the tool was promoted as a "helpmate" to the owners of the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. Google stated it just started exploring the AI tool, adding that the project won’t replace journalists or their essential roles in reporting, creating, and fact-checking. However, the New York Times reported that some executives who saw Google's pitch but asked to remain anonymous found it unsettling. There are concerns that these tools might provide inaccurate information or "hallucinate" answers because they were trained using online information. The news comes days after the Associated Press announced that it would collaborate with OpenAI, ChatGPT's owner, to investigate the use of generative AI in news writing, which could pave the way for additional industry-wide alliances. Additionally, the tech giant stated that it is seeking partnerships with news organisations to implement the AI tool in newsrooms.

Duoiba, Internsify, and Veridaq take centre stage at Pitch Friday Last Friday, we had the July edition of Pitch Friday, our monthly pitch event for early-stage startups. To set the tone, we had an informal conversation on Threads and its capacity to pose a threat to Twitter. Almost everyone present reported downloading the Threads app, while one person abandoned the process after discovering he needed an Instagram account. However, only a few people had opened the app since they first downloaded it. That's not entirely surprising. Reports show that daily active users on the newest addition to the Meta family have dropped by 20%. The reasons given for signing up on Threads largely revolved around curiosity. But the big question remained. Can Threads pose a credible threat to Twitter? Here, the opinions were evenly split. The majority of the attendees felt it could rival Twitter but not necessarily replace it. One reason given for this was having the Instagram advantage. Within a week of its launch, Threads had garnered 100 million users. Just a few months ago, ChatGPT gained 100 million users within two months of its release. However, this doesn't tell the complete story. 100 million users is less than 10% of Instagram's 2.3 billion users. A few other people argued that Twitter offered something different from other social media platforms. The consensus, though, was that it was too early to tell who would win considering both products still have a few kinks to iron out. With that out of the way, we began with the pitches. Emmanuel Udo went first, pitching Duoiba, an eCommerce startup. By 2025, the International Finance Corporation and Google estimate that the digital economy could add $180 billion a year to Africa's GDP, and Udo aims to capture a portion of that with Duoiba. By the way, you can catch a replay on our YouTube channel as well as watch other videos on the channel. Sellers on Duoiba can create online stores, while an escrow function protects buyers from being scammed. Additionally, Duoiba aims to help more Africans start drop shipping. The startup charges sellers a 2% transaction fee. There's also a monthly subscription fee of ₦‎13,000 ($14). More than 200 sellers have been onboarded on the platform, resulting in over ₦‎5 million ($5,649) in sales. Julius Osilamah was next, pitching Internsify. 60% of Africa's unemployed residents are young people. For these young people, getting a job is tough. Internsify wants to bridge the gap by providing training and internship placements. Launched in June 2022, Internsify has received more than 2,000 applications from 27 countries. It has also signed partnerships with two organisations. Accepted candidates spend the first five months learning before being assisted in getting jobs. Students on the platform also pay ₦‎50,000 ($56) during this time. Veridaq was the last startup and was presented by Ayodeji Adewusi. An identity verification startup, Veridaq is starting out by helping employers verify employee credentials. Employees can create an account on Veridaq and make a request for their work history, which is then processed and returned as a digital badge. The badge is valid for life, but users have to pay a fee to update it. All three founders got feedback and fielded questions from the audience. Pitch Friday holds on the second Friday of every month, and you can register to get a reminder for the next one.

How Flex Finance helps African businesses save money with its spend management solution It's a cliché in business circles that the easiest way to get an entrepreneur's attention is to show how their business can make or save more money. But for many businesses in Africa, spending is an arbitrary process occurring with little or no attention to detail. Take spend management for example. The average business has to make payments to vendors or suppliers, pay for maintenance of equipment, pay salaries or reimburse employees for official expenses, and rent. That's in addition to other expenses such as software costs, training programmes, and one-off payments. Historically, many African businesses have depended on manual methods to manage their finances. Others use tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Unsurprisingly, vital details frequently slip through the cracks even for the most diligent people. Furthermore, paper records can be manipulated, stolen, or lost. While the process is slightly easier for businesses that use tools like those mentioned above, it is still a laborious error-prone process. As Internet and smartphone penetration has grown in many parts of Africa, a slew of startups have thrown their hats in the ring, eager to provide a reliable solution for the over 40 million businesses on the continent. Flex Finance, a spend management startup founded by Yemi Olulana, is one of such startups, and hopes to ease the process for African businesses, tapping into an estimated $4.2 trillion worth of B2B spending. Why is spend management a big deal? One of the most important benefits of spend management is cash flow management. By accurately tracking a business' finances, entrepreneurs can avoid unnecessary or unproductive spending and possibly improve profitability in the long run. Spend management can also help businesses decide how to allocate their budget, negotiate better terms with suppliers, and plan effectively. For many African businesses, the use of manual solutions means they struggle with properly managing their finances. For them, Flex Finance provides an all-in-one solution. Businesses can track expenses, disburse payments, create spending accounts with approved limits, and issue virtual dollar cards to employees. In addition, it provides businesses with an overdraft facility to cover expenses. Imagine a business with 50 employees who spend money on behalf of the company. Without solutions like Flex Finance, employees have to manually place a request which an accountant or any approved staff has to approve manually. Many companies collect all of this data in multiple places, which they may lose, but even when that doesn't happen, not having all the required information on one platform could be burdensome. Road to 50 million jobs Olulana says that starting Flex Finance was a natural step in his goal to create 50 million jobs in Africa by empowering 50,000 companies to grow to the level where they can employ a thousand people. Over the past decade, Olulana has founded or co-founded a number of startups, including Giddiphones — a classifieds marketplace for smartphones — and RouteKing. Some of his experience has also come in the blockchain sector where he worked on business and consumer products. After exiting his last venture, he spent some time talking to business owners, and discovered that while they understood how money came into their businesses, they were unaware of the ways they spent or lost money. Flex Finance is not the only startup that sees an opportunity in helping African businesses manage their finances. Sava — a South African startup that raised $2 million in 2022 — and Bujeti, a YC-backed company are just two direct competitors. Other startups like Bento and FairMoney provide some of the same services that Flex Finance offers. With some of Flex Finance's products looking similar to those of other businesses, Olulana explains the three-year-old startup's mission. "There are two types of business spend. There's the payroll and non-payroll spend. The problem that Flex solves for businesses is we help them manage non-payroll spend, [which is in] two categories — employee reimbursement and vendor payment. "Despite digitising many aspects of their operations, most businesses still handle this part manually, leading to a waste of time and money. Flex is able to position itself as the central nervous system of a business, helping them to manage non-payroll spend." Since its launch, Flex Finance has been used by more than 2,000 businesses in Nigeria, including Sporting Lagos, TalentQL, and Pricepally. But while its solutions work for businesses of all types, Olulana says that Flex Finance is highly focused on digitally enabled businesses. "We do not serve micro SMEs. We serve formal SMEs, startups, and mid-level enterprises. We find that segment of the market is a fast-growing section in the region. With the wave of digitisations and this market segment being early adopters of technology, we expect that segment to continue to grow." Flex Finance charges a 0.1% fee capped at ₦‎50,000 for all businesses that use the platform, while transactions above ₦‎200 million get a custom fee. With many finance tools for businesses being built, Olulana stresses that Flex Finance's goal is to provide clarity for its customers, empowering them with insights to make more data-driven decisions. "We had one of our businesses that was able to spot how much they were spending on a particular vendor and realised they could renegotiate certain terms and save money on that vendor relationship. Prior to Flex, they didn't have that level of insight on their business spending and we've seen several cases like that of businesses being able to expand their operations because they now have more visibility into their operations." The startup has raised more than $500,000 from investors such as The Mastercard Foundation, Catalyst Fund, LoftyInc Capital Management, Berrywood Capital, and Gumroad CEO, Sahil Lavingia. However, Olulana explains that it is not in a hurry to raise more capital. "We're well capitalised and growing extremely fast. We have good cash flow from our customers that are running our operations and yes, we are lucky to be backed by some of the world's leading investors. We're well capitalised to go on this mission to empower businesses in Africa."
Why this Chinese investor is betting big on Africa's Web3 potential It may be hard to believe, but Africa's Web3 and blockchain sectors were the toast of investors about a year ago. After raising just $5.1 million in 2021, Web3 startups in Africa raised $88 million in 2022. But 2022 also came with interesting developments. After facing a liquidity crunch in November 2022, the repercussions of FTX's quick shut down were felt across the globe. Nestcoin lost some of its funds held by the crypto exchange, prompting the Web3 startup to lay off staff. These developments have contributed to reduced investor activity in the sector, but a few people are still hopeful. In December 2022, Uwem Uwemakpan expressed hope that African cryptocurrency startups would see renewed investor activity and pointed out that it still had some utility in Africa. While that hope has not materialised, one man is confident in Africa's Web3 potential, backing some notable names in the sector. Vincent Li, Founding Partner, Adaverse, is our guest on Equity Merchants and he shares reasons for his optimism. Hello Vincent, it's great to have you on the podcast. Before we dive into our conversation, can you introduce yourself? I started my career in China 15 years ago, as a product manager. So I did all kinds of products starting from Web1. After several years, I started investing. So I oversaw investment in Silicon Valley, India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin America since 2015. At the same time, I started my startup called Qutoutiao Inc., a Chinese news aggregator targeting lower-tier cities in China. It went viral, and we just spent two and a half years from zero to getting listed on NASDAQ in 2018. After that, I decided to go all in on emerging markets. I joined Transsion Holdings and started working in Africa. I established Future Hub, the Transsion Holdings-backed seed fund and incubator, in 2019 and officially started my career in Africa, especially in Nigeria. I've made a couple of investments since then, and also done some venture building. In 2021, I started a bunch of Web3 ventures. Right now I'm the Founding Partner of Adaverse, Co-founder of Future Hub, and Co-founder of two other startups — Vibra and Cassava Network. What got you started with Web3 investing? From my previous experience, I just see the evolution of technology from Web1, then Web2, and then Web3. So to me, it's just like a natural evolution of web technology. That's one. Secondly, I see more space for Web3 to disrupt emerging markets like Africa. There are so many new opportunities, and so many places that we can leverage the Web3 technology. VCs are typically guided by a thesis; they're either investing in fintech startups or climate tech startups. What guides your investments in Web3 startups in Africa? We really like the companies in Africa that can solve real world problems by leveraging the power of blockchain and Web3. Most of the startups or companies from the United States or Asia are pretty much crypto-native companies. They're building layer one, the blockchain itself, or building different applications on-chain. For example, they're building things like DeFi lending or DeFi exchange. It's nothing to do with the real world if I may say. On the contrary, if you look at economies in Africa, quite a few founders try to solve real world problems using the blockchain. For example, we invested in House Africa, from Nigeria. What they do is that they try to use blockchain to verify the land parcel. It's a great solution they offer to the buyers and also to the developers, to build trust and solve the trust issue. You've been in Africa for a bit, so you probably have a better understanding compared to when you first arrived. What are specific use cases for Web3 that you can see, especially now that the hype seems to have died down? Before answering that, I'd like to clarify some concepts. Firstly we have blockchain and then we have tokens or cryptocurrencies. Thirdly, we have Web3 and the ownership of digital assets. When we talk about blockchain, it's just a ledger where people keep their transaction history. It has nothing to do with tokens or with cryptocurrency. With the blockchain, we can do a lot of things. As I mentioned, we use blockchain to store and verify data. So in this case study we have House Africa, as I mentioned. We also invested in Chekkit, a Nigerian company dealing with counterfeit issues using the blockchain. So it's nothing to do with tokens, cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges, or those kinds of things; it's purely technology. When we talk about the second part, cryptocurrency, I see quite a lot of people here who think blockchain is cryptocurrency. For example, they see Bitcoin as blockchain. They see USDT as blockchain, but actually, it's just the tokens or it's just a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain. So that is the hype we see, and we also see all the crashes. The third thing is Web3. Based on the blockchain, you have the tokens, which are more like gas to a car. When the token value is widely accepted by a bunch of people, which we call a consensus, we see the tokens as a cryptocurrency. Web3 is all about people owning their own digital assets instead of giving all the data to a centralised platform. For the Web3 part, we also have a couple of investment deals, TalkSay for instance. They provide an online audio chat room for Hausa people to exchange their thoughts, exchange their ideas, or maybe just do fun things. For the moment, I think apart from the hype, we still see a lot of good founders. They're using blockchain to solve issues. They also leverage the spirit of Web3 to bring that ownership back to the users. How do you help portfolio companies navigate unclear regulations around Web3 and the blockchain? We're seeing this challenge in many places. From the United States to China and down here in Africa. But let me start with the three elements — the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3. We see many bad things happening typically around cryptocurrency. Most of the regulations from different countries also focus on cryptocurrency. In Nigeria, it's the same thing. I noticed that we just got the regulation of blockchain like several weeks ago. But, I believe it's still about the regulation of cryptocurrency, it's the regulation of money. We see quite a few companies doing great things without integrating any cryptocurrency, or without receiving any money from the end user. I don't really see any regulated risk for them. The spirit of web3 is to give ownership back to the user. Of course, the platform will take a split of revenue but, by and large, it's the user who owns the digital assets. As long as we have a very clear boundary on this, I think that the companies are fine, they can do their business. But if it is highly related to financial products, then my suggestion is that the founders need to be working with the government very closely to make themselves as compliant as possible. What are some lessons you've learnt in the almost three years you've been investing in Africa? I would say two things. The first is that we need to be patient because investment itself is highly dependent on the cycle. It's not a short-term thing, like crypto trading, so we need to have a long term persistence, and long term commitment to support our portfolio companies in the long run. The other thing is that, compared with the capital, I feel that we should offer more experience, knowledge, mentorship, and support. At Adaverse, we don't just invest, but we also provide the acceleration programme or support. After the investment, we include the company and the founder in our accelerator programme where we offer extensive support in four major topics starting from product design, technical support, community building, and fundraising and listing advisory. During this whole curriculum, we try to equip them with as much Web3 knowledge as possible. This is essential because now we see many great founders in Africa who know how to hire a team, how to build a team, how to build a product, and how to build a business model. Quite a lot of them don't really have the Web3 knowledge yet although they're very keen to learn from others. When we provide this kind of acceleration support to them, it's highly complimentary to their own skill set. So how long does the accelerator last? A typical cohort lasts three months sliced into three different phases. There's the one-on-one diagnostic with our internal advisors and experts. In the second phase, we match them with the relevant experts outside, so that they can have mentorship sessions. The third phase is more like public workshops and also demo days for them to present themselves. Earlier you mentioned that every market has its unique nuances that affect how business is conducted. How do you work with partners to ensure that your portfolio companies in Africa have the benefit of your global Web3 experience, but also learn from people who have done business in Africa? I can think of two major angles. So the first angle is among our portfolio companies; they can already learn from each other. For example, the founder of Chekkit can learn how the founder of House Africa leverages blockchain technology in their product. So they can have that internal communication based on the platform we offer during the acceleration programme. The other is that we also help them to expand to other markets where their solutions can be applied. Besides solving real world issues, what are the other factors that you look out for when you decide to invest in a startup? Apart from the major thesis, we also have founder criteria. So we welcome founders who have been working in the same area with some relevant experience, and we also consider the stage of their product or their company. We prefer to invest post-MVP, which means they at least have a workable product, with some early-stage traction, for example, a couple of clients, or maybe hundreds of users so that we can easily evaluate the proof of concept. And the third thing is, for sure, their openness to the new technology, especially blockchain and Web3. You're investing in an emerging market, so it's a little bit harder to get exits, especially in Africa. How do you prepare for that on your part, and secondly with the founder? As investors, we need to see returns. But as I mentioned, the two lessons I have learned here are persistence and offering more support. I think we just need to respect those two factors. We have a long-term vision in Africa and that's why we established the $100 million fund. We tend to respect the momentum of the founder and also the market. The second thing is that the support we are offering can also help the company grow. The more business we can bring to the founder, the more regional expansion we can facilitate for the founder, the quicker the company can grow and we can expect more returns. We've come to the end of this. Thank you, Vincent, for coming around. Thank you, it's a pleasure.

Ethiopia ends a 5-month social media ban The City of Cape Town has introduced a municipal app that residents can use to view their load-shedding schedules, report a challenge, access online services, and stay informed about the City's news. Available on App Store and Play Store, residents can participate in municipal decision-making on the platform. Deputy Mayor, Eddie Andrews, said the decision to introduce a comprehensive app was due to the pilot success of Cape Town's load-shedding app in 2022. Here's what I've got for you today: Ethiopia ends a 5-month social media ban Nigeria plans to develop electric vehicles Kenyans to send and receive money from South-East Asia Banks, telcos to register with the Nigerian Data Protection Commission by December 2023 Ethiopia ends a 5-month social media ban Ethiopia has lifted Internet restrictions imposed in February 2023 due to anti-government protests brought on by conflicts within the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC). Here’s what happened: When three church leaders proclaimed themselves archbishops and established their governing body in January 2023, protests erupted in the Oromiya region. While some protesters criticised their action, others backed it. The Ethiopian state has long had close ties with the Orthodox Church — more than 40% of its citizens are members. As at February 10, the church reported that over 30 people had been killed, accusing the Ethiopian government of "meddling" in its internal affairs even after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed asked his ministers to stay out of the dispute. Following the ban, human rights organisations criticised the decision. In March 2023, Amnesty International said the restriction blatantly violated people's rights to freedom of expression and access to information. A local Chief Security Officer (CSO), Center for the Advancement of Rights and Democracy (CARD), claimed last week that Ethiopia suffered a staggering economic loss of more than $140 million due to the five-month Internet ban. Sidebar Alert: In June 2023, Senegal censored access to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Telegram in response to a widespread protest over the sentencing of opposition leader Ousmane Sonko. The Senegalese government hasn’t lifted the ban. Nigeria plans to develop electric vehicles The Nigerian government has announced plans to begin the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs) as part of its Automotive Policy. This comes as the fuel pump price has risen to ₦‎617 ($0.78) per litre in the country following subsidy removal. Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment, Evelyn Ngige, represented by the ministry's Director of Industry Development, Adewale Bakare, noted that the plan outlines the steps the government will take to develop, expand, and use EVs in Nigeria. In other EV news, the Nigerian Government, via the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), has acquired Jet Motors’ locally assembled EVs and their charging infrastructure. Chidi Ajaere, Chairman of the GIG Group, founded Jet Motors in 2018 to provide affordable and eco-friendly transportation options in Africa. The company also manufactures a range of electric vehicles, including delivery vans, ambulances, and military and utility vehicles. In April 2023, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwolu, announced the arrival of the first set of electric buses in the Lagos State Mass Transit Plan. Kenyans to send and receive money from South-East Asia Safaricom has collaborated with UK-based fintech company, TerraPay, to enable over 32 million M-PESA customers to send and receive money to over 200 million people in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Customers can send and receive funds to these countries via the M-PESA Global service available through the M-PESA Super app. They can also dial the USSD code, *334#, and select M-PESA Global from the "Send Money" menu. The telco mentioned that M-PESA customers will soon send and receive money to people in India and Nepal in a few months. With the addition of TerraPay, the M-PESA Global service now offers more than 35 partners, allowing customers in Kenya to send and receive money and send and receive payments to more than 170 different countries. In Safaricom's most recent fiscal year, over 917,000 M-PESA Global service users used it to conduct more than 31.8 million transactions totalling over Ksh 418 billion. Thus, M-PESA handled more than 90% of the country’s remittances. Banks, telcos to register with the Nigerian Data Protection Commission by December 2023 All banks, telcos, schools, and other businesses that manage Nigerians' data must register with the Nigerian Data Protection Commission (NDPC) for data compliance monitoring by December 2023. The National Commissioner of the NDPC, Vincent Olatunji, stated yesterday at a sensitisation forum on the Nigeria Data Protection Act that doing so follows the Act's provisions, which require all data controllers and data processors to register within six months of the law's enactment. Nigeria has over 500,000 data processors and controllers, and Olatunji said the law specifies that the NDPC must give these organisations six months to become familiar with its provisions. Why should you care? Olatunji stated that every Nigerian is a data subject because they all have data with either the government or private organisations. Consequently, you have the choice to consent or not to the collection of your data and the right to correct inaccurate data. Additionally, you are entitled to transfer your data from one data controller to another. On the other hand, data controllers and data processors owe you the duty of care and accountability to ensure that the data with them is well protected.What's more, between January and March 2024, all registered organisations must submit annual audit reports to the commission, informing the NDPC of their progress in protecting Nigerians’ data. Let's take a walk down memory lane from a similar situation in 2020.

Kenya's first online university could be funded by KSh 1.8 billion of taxpayers' money You're probably wondering why you are seeing a different name. Unfortunately, your usual host, Victoria, is under the weather and I'm taking over for the day. Don't worry, she'll be back soon. How'd your day go? Lately, I've begun to see Mondays as just another day and I hope it continues that way. It's leading to a more fulfulling week and I'm here for that. Meanwhile, Angolans and Zambians might be getting cheaper Internet soon thanks to Liquid Dataport, a subsidiary of Liquid Intelligent Technologies. The company announced plans to expand its fibre backbone to connect Luanda, Angola and Lusaka, Zambia directly. Here's what I've got for you today: Nigerians loss 85.1% less money to banking fraud in Q1 2023 Kenya's first online university Nigerians loss 85.1% less money to banking fraud in Q1 2023 A new report on banking fraud and forgeries released by the Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC) has revealed that Nigerians lost 85.1% less money to banking fraud in the first quarter of 2023, compared to Q4 2022. In Q1 2023, Nigerians lost ₦472 million from a total of 12,533 reported cases. In comparison, they lost ₦3.1 billion in 14,609 cases in Q4 2022. Going by the report, banks recovered 85.13 per cent more money than the preceding quarter and fewer cases were reported — 14.07% less. The amount involved also decreased to ₦2.5 billion from ₦12.5 billion — a 79.44% drop. In comparison to the first quarter of 2022, this year's Q1 saw less cases reported (69.02%), less money involved (82.34%), and more money recovered (69.35%). These fraudulent activities were performed using various channels including ATMs, web, mobile banking platforms (including USSD & eNaira), bank branches, and Point of Sale (PoS) terminals. Interestingly, PoS fruad increased by 19.51% to 1,985 cases, up from 1,661 in the preceding quarter. Other channels showed a decrease in fraudulent activities: ATM - 38.61% less, mobile - 9.78% decrease, and web - 17.81% drop. Also, more bank employees (15) had their jobs terminated for participating in banking fraud, up from 12 in Q4 2022. Kenya's first online university Kenya's parliament has approved the establishment of the country's first online university — Open University of Kenya (OUK). Last week, the National Assembly approved the draft charter for the Open University of Kenya, which upon ratification could see as many as 7,100 students admitted in its first cohort. The school would be based at the Konza Technopolis in Machakos and KSh1.86 billion of taxpayers' money would be used to run OUK in its first year. This is to "meet most of the initial costs of setting up physical facilities, information communication technology and support, design, production, acquisition of learning/teaching materials and learner support services." Students could get a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Data Science, Economics and Statistics, Technology Education, paying between KSh10,400 and KSh10,900 per module, depending on the course. Other degrees include Bachelor of Cyber Security and Digital Forensics, Bachelor of Science in Business and Entrepreneurship. For diploma courses, students could pay KSh130,000 per year. This isn't the first time a Kenyan government has begun the process of establishing a virtual university. In 2014, an Uhuru Kenyatta-led government announced plans to set up an open learning university. However, it was never launched.

"AI in Nigeria has not even started crawling" - tech experts on the state of artificial intelligence in Nigeria The news Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Nigeria still has a long way to go, according to experts, who spoke at the Lagos Startup Week. The experts discussed challenges and the necessary infrastructure that needs to be put in place to foster AI innovation in Nigeria. One of the biggest challenges facing the country in terms of AI growth is education. While Nigeria has AI startups such as Uniccon Group, the creators of Nigeria's first humanoid robot, the state of AI in Nigeria is still very much in its infancy. Experts in Nigeria's tech ecosystem confirmed this on July 14, 2023, at the Lagos Startup Week, saying AI in the country is not even crawling yet. While discussing how to foster AI innovation in the country, Dolapo Akinbisola, Country Head at SmartComplyApp, believes the path to AI innovation has to start with education. "We have to intentionally ensure that it is a part of our curriculum," he said. Olumide Okubadejo, AI Research Scientist at Spotify, also corroborated Akinbola's stance by saying Nigeria does not have the talent to drive AI technology. "how many people can build a face detection pipeline or speech detection pipeline in Nigeria?" He asked. Beyond education, other factors are impeding the growth of AI in Nigeria. From connectivity to infrastructure Nkem Nweke, Microsoft African Development Centre (ADC), Engineering Innovations Lead, highlighted how proper Internet connectivity is proportional to GDP growth. Per World Bank, "GDP growth has coincided, among other things, with the rapid expansion of Internet connectivity." Research by McKinsey has also revealed that the Internet plays a crucial role in economic growth rates, as it accounts for 3.4% of the GDP of developing economies. However, Statista puts Internet penetration in the country at 38.73% as of 2022. Creating policies that will shape AI growth Digital Governance Specialist Victor Famubode believes that making the right AI policies needs to start with creating awareness. He said the government needs to make sure that it is communicating the opportunities and risks that are associated with AI and, at the same time, promoting responsible usage of the technology. It is also important that the government finds a way to incentivise communities that can help drive open innovation. "When you look at ChatGPT and a lot of these large language models, the foundation for how they were birthed is from a place of open science. We have these models today because open science was allowed in developed economies." While Nigeria does not currently have a comprehensive AI policy, it has shown interest in the advancement of technology. For example, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), published research on the impact of AI in society to provide policymakers with insights into what is possible with AI. However, Famubode believes that the era of policies playing catch-up with technology has passed and policymakers need to move fast to ensure rapid innovation of AI in Nigeria.
Starlink launches in Kenya, chooses Karibu Connect as its authorised reseller Elon Musk, CEO of US-based space exploration company, SpaceX, has announced that Starlink, its satellite Internet service, is now available in Kenya. In January 2023, SpaceX announced plans to launch Starlink in Q2 of the year. At the time, anyone in Kenya could pre-order the service and deposit a fully refundable KSh12,260 ($99) to reserve it. But now, customers will pay a total of KSh 92,100 ($650), which includes a non-refundable KSh 99 booking fee, KSh 3100 ($22) for shipping and installation, and KSh 89,000 ($628) for the kit — the Starlink dish, mounting stand, cables, and a power source. The company also charges a monthly subscription fee of KSh 6500 ($46), which is expensive. Regional providers, such as Safaricom and Zuku, charge a fraction of that for traditional fibre-powered broadband connections. Typically, customers pay a monthly subscription fee to their Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and they offer other hardware like routers for free. While Starlink charges more, local ISPs provide an Ethernet cable without charge. Consequently, the price may be a challenge for some customers who are on a tight budget and rely on inexpensive data bundles and free public Wi-Fi hotspots. In 2021, over 8.9 million Kenyans lived in extreme poverty, many of whom lived in rural areas. Also, more than 7.8 million Kenyans lived in rural areas on less than $1.90 daily. Further, Internet connectivity solutions provider, Karibu Connect, announced that it is now the first authorised Starlink reseller in Kenya. Expectedly, the company will supply Starlink to diverse sectors in rural Kenya. John Thuo, CEO of Karibu Connect, claims the collaboration marks a significant advancement in the company's goal of bringing high-quality, reasonably priced internet access to every part of Kenya. However, it is not clear how much Kabiru Connect will charge. Meanwhile, Starlink's entry into Kenya will make it the sixth African country where the satellite Internet service is currently available. Nigeria was first, followed by Mozambique, Rwanda, Mauritius, and Sierra Leone. This comes after Safaricom announced its partnership with AST SpaceMobile — a competitor of Starlink — to launch a satellite Internet service to challenge Starlink. Safaricom plans to launch a satellite Internet service to challenge Starlink in Kenya AST SpaceMobile uses a constellation of satellites that can communicate directly with common 4G smartphones to provide low-cost broadband connectivity to rural and remote areas.
Nigerian insurtech startup, MyCover.ai, has raised a $1.25 million pre-seed to invest in its proprietary technology Nigerian insurtech startup, MyCover.ai, has raised a $1.25 million pre-seed round to support its internal operations and tech talent. Ventures Platform led the round, with participation from Founders Factory Africa and TechStars. Adebowale Banjo (CEO), Alexander Igwe-Ifendu (CPO), and Fred Ebho (CTO) founded MyCover.ai in 2021 to provide an open insurance API that allows businesses to embed insurance into their existing products and services. The company says it addresses challenges the African insurance market faces, including a lack of access, insufficient coverage, high insurance costs, and poor customer experience when dealing with insurance processes. It addresses these challenges by operating across three crucial touchpoints: distribution, underwriting and product development, and insurance claims. It streamlines the claims process for insurance companies and end users. It also integrates with insurance companies like Hygeia, Leadway, Sovereign Trust, AIICO Insurance, and Allianz via an open insurance API and offers over 30 customised insurance products. Other companies and innovators can use this open insurance API to integrate these insurance products into their platforms. The startup works with insurance companies to ensure the distribution of its products through its API. MyCover.ai claims it makes it simple for startups and companies to integrate insurance into their offerings via its API and Software Development Kit (SDK). Doing so enables seamless insurance offerings to customers and, ultimately, increases revenue. Since its launch, MyCover.ai claims to have generated over $1 million in gross written premiums through alliances with 30 insurance companies nationwide. What’s more, the startup plans to use the funds to strategically expand its operations into additional African markets and invest in its proprietary technology.
Threads' daily active users drop by 20%. Twitter is not its only competition Key takeaways: Threads, Meta's Twitter rival, has seen a 20% dip in daily active users despite rapid post-launch signups. Threads gained 30 million users within the first few hours of its launch and crossed 100 million after five days. Twitter has since reacted by rolling out a revenue-sharing programme for verified creators and filing a lawsuit against Threads. Meta's Twitter clone, Threads, has experienced a 20% drop in the number of daily active users of the platform and a 50% decline — 20 minutes to 10 minutes — in the amount of time spent on the platform. This is according to data shared with CNBC by Sensor Tower, a marketing intelligence firm, which also reveals that the decline began on Saturday, July 15, 2023. Twitter is not Threads only competition Although Threads recorded 100 million signups in five days, it still has to fight for the attention of users from not only Twitter but other platforms like TikTok, and YouTube. Unlike Threads, where users spend 10 minutes daily, Tweeters spend an average of 34 minutes. TikTok keeps users scrolling for almost 60 minutes, while YouTube keeps them for almost 50. Twitter also just started sharing revenue with creators, a development that got many users declaring they will never leave the app. It is also suing Meta for poaching employees who allegedly shared Twitter's trade secrets. Elon is on steroids…Yeah people are definitely not leaving twitter Is Twitter more interesting? Though data reveals the use of hate speech doubled after Musk took over Twitter, some users find the platform more interesting than Threads. From news to dragging/cooking — Twitter lingo for calling out users on the platform — some people claim to enjoy Twitter's controversial and combative nature. And this is one of the things Threads does not want on its platform. "The goal isn't to replace Twitter," said Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, "the goal is to create a public square for communities on Instagram that never really embraced Twitter and for communities on Twitter (and other platforms) that are interested in a less angry place for conversations, but not all of Twitter." Mosseri says that politics and hard news will show up on Threads, like on Instagram, but they will not be encouraged. It is still early days and we can't tell what will become of Threads. We've seen Instagram go from a platform for sharing moments with friends and family to one where we consume content from random strangers. If we go by Meta's history, Threads will tread the path of most profitability.
Africans spent 2.7m+ hours learning online. What's next for education on the continent? One thing that I noticed in all my conversations with folks in the West about the future of learning for Africans is their belief that Africans don't have the technological infrastructure and discipline to learn online. I had a lengthy conversation with a Stanford PhD student in April last year that echoed the same sentiments. I concluded that we needed to prove if they were right or wrong. To do this, we’d need to give people the opportunity to learn online and use data from this experience to validate or disprove the aforementioned belief. Fast forward 14 months, and AltSchool graduated over 1,072 African software engineers who spent more than 2.7 million hours learning. This ushers us into the next chapter of learning in Africa. In this article, I pen down my thoughts on some things that will happen to learning in Africa in the next decade and some of our approaches to learning. Content localisation (local context goes a long way) One of the major challenges I faced while learning how to write code many years ago was the difficulty in connecting with tutors from India because I couldn’t understand the learning context in which they were training students. This got me disinterested and made it hard for me to acquire the knowledge and skills I’d set out to gain. The first thing my team and I did when starting AltSchool was to find out if we could get content partners and trainers that were Africans, people with similar lived experiences as their learners who understood the socio-cultural context that shapes the teaching-learning process, hence student outcomes. This is what culturally responsive teaching entails. Accessibility (learners need to be able to access it anywhere) In an increasingly interconnected world, learning must be location-agnostic. We knew from the beginning that we had to be location-agnostic to afford millions of people access to quality learning regardless of their location. By adopting this approach, we have facilitated a rich tapestry of cultural differences among our community of learners who have come from more than 72 countries of the world! We have made sure that everything about the value chain of our programmes is fully online, investing in technical infrastructure and products to make it easy and effective for learners anywhere in Africa. Communal learning and connection (nothing beats community learning) Africans are community-oriented people. This is a value that is ingrained in our DNA and sets us apart from the rest of the world. The proverbial saying that “it takes a village to raise a child” is baked into how we view things. We had to make learning a social event, putting different methods into the community effort. This has helped retain the students and helped them have a community to lean on when they face tougher challenges. We have seen people connect offline because they share similar interests regardless of their African roots. This connection goes from Nigeria to Rwanda to Ghana, and even to the West. There is hardly a state or country I go to that I don’t get to meet an AltSchooler. Learning must be fun One of our core ideologies is that learning should be fun. People see the word “School” and think of something rigid and boring. This has stigmatised learning and only a few try to go into it. We understood this and critically thought about how to make learning fun for our learners regardless of their African background. This provided several outlets for students to connect and engage as they learnt. We added weekly social events for them to interact and learn from top professionals in their fields of study. I have seen how these students engage with each other on Twitter and throw bants at each other with a common denominator — Learning. Practical not theory Take knowledge into the workplace. We have content partners in the workplace, and our students get to practise what they learn in class with case studies existing in the workplace. Some of them have even secured coveted tech internships at prestigious organisations such as UNDP, OnePipe, Sterling Bank, and OurPass among others. They can quickly adapt their learning to the workplace because of the teaching methods. Learning needs to be profitable Learning has been termed an unprofitable venture for learners. It is seen as something you just need to do. But, learning needs to be profitable to the learner such that they can see clear outcomes. This is why we have invested in creating a career service that helps learners understand their career path and place them with internships and jobs. If people must take learning seriously, it needs to translate to career growth. To educate the next billion Africans, we need to go beyond the four walls of the classroom and harness the vast potential of the Internet. But to do that, we must use an approach that is different from the theoretical system because the attention span of an online user is lower than that of a learner in a physical school. We need a learning framework crafted specifically for Africans, by Africans. And I firmly believe that Africa has the power to redefine how learning operates on a grand scale.
Jumia Kenya’s employee stole $150,000 by manipulating vendor payment records eCommerce company, Jumia Kenya, has announced that it lost KSh 21.2 million ($150,000) to fraud. The company said one of its employees stole the funds by manipulating vendor payment records. Jumia Kenya, in a Berlin-based Jumia Technologies AG filing published in May 2023, says it discovered the fraud in September 2022. “In September 2022, we discovered that an employee in Kenya manipulated certain vendor payment entries and misappropriated payments in 2021 and 2022.” Jumia Technologies AG is the trading group under which Jumia Kenya falls. It lists some main risks that could hurt its business, including failure to deal with fraud effectively and fictitious transactions made on its platform. Jumia Kenya says that although vendors can list their products on the platform and sellers can order and pay for goods before or after delivery, it can be challenging to anticipate, identify, and deal with fraudulent activities. The business claims it is due to the industry's fragmentation and the large number of users on its platform. While the financial impact, in this case, was not material (under $150,000), any similar illegal, fraudulent, or collusive activities by its employees could significantly hurt its operations, finances, results, and prospects. They could also expose the company to legal risk or adverse publicity. In 2019, the eCommerce platform reported losing at least KSh118 million in two years due to consumer cyber fraud and robbery. A break-in at its Kenyan warehouse resulted in the loss of KSh56 million in merchandise. What’s more, a group of customers fraudulently used electronic payment providers to buy goods in 2017, costing the company KSh62 million.
Egypt's central bank partners CBN to support digital transformation MTN Ghana plans to invest $1 billion to expand its network over the next five years. The telco says it has invested $25 million to support Ghana's digital goal and give the youth more influence. The company's Acting Chief Enterprise Business Officer, Daniel Asare, claims that Ayoba — MTN's super app — currently has 2.5 million users and 50 micro apps. He also added that Mobile Money (MoMo) has 280,000 agents and 140,000 active merchants across Ghana. However, he said that the company faces several challenges, including fibre cut-off, MoMo fraud, network issues, and the effect these had on the customers. Here's what I've got for you today: Egypt's central bank partners CBN to support digital transformation MTN Rwanda and Bboxx partner to make smartphones more available Egypt's central bank partners CBN to support digital transformation The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to support electronic banking services and digital transformation. This MoU focuses on the exchange of expertise in fintech, innovation, electronic payment, and financial inclusion. CBN's Deputy Governor, Aishah Ahmad, stated that the partnership would strengthen information sharing and cross-border regulatory collaboration, foster innovation, and increase regional technology investments. The CBE signed another MoU with the London Institute of Banking and Finance (LIBF) to offer specialised training courses, workshops, and programmes to Egypt's fintech industry leaders. This strategic alliance aims to equip Egyptian fintech professionals with cutting-edge knowledge and abilities, promoting an environment of growth and innovation within the sector. Expectedly, the MoUs will pave the way for significant changes to Egypt's fintech landscape. MTN Rwanda and Bboxx partner to make smartphones more available Solar energy company, Bboxx, and MTN Rwanda have partnered to increase smartphone availability in Rwanda in a bid to close the digital divide, thus bringing Internet connectivity to unconnected areas. Why does it matter? Despite 99% network coverage, Rwanda has a smartphone penetration rate of under 20%. This partnership complements the government's and MTN’s programme, Connect Rwanda, which aims to provide smartphones for every household. Bboxx will provide Rwandans with a more accessible way to pay for their smartphones through Bboxx Connect, its pay-as-you-go smartphone service. It will provide flexible repayment plans of six or twelve months to customers who sign up for the service. They can make payments via the MTN Mobile Money USSD code, *182*2*4*2#.

The Potential for Cryptocurrency Growth in Africa Africa contains some of the youngest and fastest growing populations in the world. As internet and smartphone access expands across the continent, there is huge potential for increased cryptocurrency adoption. Africa has already seen impressive crypto growth in recent years. In this article, we explore the opportunities and challenges for further cryptocurrency integration in Africa. You can bet today from anywhere using a mobile phone. 1xbet is one of the biggest and reliable bookmakers in this category. You can download the 1xbet mobile-app and get acquainted with its functionality. It offers a welcome pack of promotions right after you register on the website. You are able to place a bet on any sports event. here you will find all the necessary information https://ghanasoccernet.com/ng/app-reviews/1xbet-nigeria-app/. Expanding Internet Connectivity One of the main barriers to crypto adoption in Africa has been lack of internet access. However, connection rates are improving rapidly with smartphone usage projected to hit 50% by 2025. Initiatives like Google Loon and Facebook Express WiFi are bringing wireless broadband to remote areas. As more Africans come online, easier internet access will allow greater participation in cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi). Platforms should focus on mobile-first designs and lightweight apps optimized for slower connections to drive crypto engagement. Young Demographic Over 60% of Africans are under age 25, making it the continent with the world's youngest population. These digital natives are eager to adopt new technologies like crypto. Young Africans are also more financially excluded compared to the global average, facing challenges accessing traditional banking and loans. Cryptocurrencies have appeal as an alternative financial system that provides the unbanked with opportunities for wealth creation outside restrictive legacy structures. Startups like Floatpay enable young workers without credit to collect their wages in cryptocurrency. Expanding Use Cases Beyond trading and speculation, cryptocurrencies are growing popular in Africa for remittances, fundraising, cross-border transactions, and as a stable alternative to volatile national currencies. Nigerians traded over $400 million worth of crypto in 2021, predominantly for remittances and to preserve savings against devaluation of the Naira. Cryptocurrency also facilitates rapid donor relief for humanitarian crises and offers decentralized finance access. Grassroots adoption is visible in crypto education initiatives by Bundle Africa and Binance Masterclasses. However, complex user experiences inhibit widespread non-tech-savvy use. User-friendly fiat on-ramps, wallets and applications tailored for African markets will drive broader engagement. Regulatory Developments Regulation remains a major hurdle to mainstream crypto acceptance in Africa. Nigeria recently eased restrictions after an initial Central Bank ban, while South Africa is creating a regulatory framework expected in 2023. Adoption by African governments will likely accelerate as they recognize cryptocurrency use cases and seek tax revenues. Clear regulations that protect consumers while encouraging innovation will provide the necessary legal certainty for large-scale crypto penetration. Policymakers should collaborate with African crypto leaders to develop appropriate frameworks for local contexts. Looking Ahead With its youthful population, growing internet access and swelling remittance activity, Africa seems primed as the next big growth market for cryptocurrency. However, work remains to craft bespoke crypto products and user experiences tailored to African market needs. If cryptocurrency startups and governments can cooperate to address UX challenges and policy barriers, the future looks bright. Crypto has the potential to dramatically expand financial inclusion and economic opportunity across the continent. Cryptocurrency Growth Strategies for Africa For cryptocurrency to realize its potential in Africa, both startups and policymakers need strategies that address the unique landscape. Here are some recommendations: Mobile-first design: Build simple, light crypto apps optimized for basic smartphones and slower connections. Complexity is a major UX barrier. Localized products: Don't just copy-paste crypto models from other regions. Innovate payment flows and use cases tailored to African consumer needs. Grassroots marketing: Run educational campaigns, in-person workshops and influencer campaigns to drive organic adoption. Broad crypto literacy is critical. Partnerships: Collaborate with telcos, banks and payment processors to enable easier on-ramps and integration with existing financial infrastructure. Community building: Create regional crypto forums and events to unite startups, users, investors and regulators. Strong ecosystems are key. Policy roadshows: Proactively engage with governments across Africa to craft appropriate crypto regulations. Seek win-win frameworks to address risks and enable innovation. Talent development: Support coding academies and incubators to grow African crypto/blockchain developer talent. Local talent powers sustainable ecosystems. Research: Conduct user studies and market analysis to identify needs, perceptions and barriers affecting crypto adoption. Let data guide product and policy strategies. With a thoughtful crypto growth strategy tailored to the continent, Africa can unlock cryptocurrency's potential for financial inclusion, efficiency and economic growth. The opportunities are vast, but realizing them requires ground-up innovation rather than importing models built elsewhere. Africa's crypto future will be bright if startups and governments commit to collaborative strategies that put local users first.
Global product leaders lead the call for African innovation, technology and growth at the Inspire Africa Conference On September 18, 2023, the Innovate Africa Foundation joined forces with the Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG), WorkNigeria, and Interswitch to kickstart the 'Inspire Africa Conference' at the Eko Convention Centre in Lagos, Nigeria. This four-day event aimed to inspire Africa's young talent to harness the power of technology to shape the continent's future. Rebecca King, representing the Innovate Africa Foundation, highlighted the conference's pivotal role in elevating the capabilities of African youth in product development. The workshops will provide emerging talents with entry-level career opportunities and deepen the knowledge of those already in the product ecosystem. This will contribute towards enhancing product innovation not only in Nigeria but also across Africa. Marty Cagan, renowned global product leader and founder of SVPG, emphasised the importance of young African minds leveraging technology to establish transformative enterprises capable of creating meaningful employment opportunities for the continent's fast-growing youth population. Cagan guided the audience through a journey of guiding principles and concepts in product management. He stated that products are powered by insights and that it is a team sport. He added that product teams should have direct access to users, data, and stakeholders to create a good product. He spoke about product discovery as the process by which an effective solution is developed, emphasising its role in managing risks. Cagan also touched on product delivery, noting that small, consistent changes are more effective than seasonal updates. He closed with the concept of a product culture, asserting that great product teams have great cultures. Finally, he advised the audience, 'You have to overcome your fear of failure to build your product.' Cagan proceeded to introduce the industry heavyweights who make up the esteemed partners of the Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG): Jon Moore, Lea Hickman, Chris Jones, Martina Lauchengco, and Christian Idiodi, all of whom actively participated in the conference and workshop training. The conference featured a range of insightful panel sessions, providing an invaluable platform for participants to glean insights. One of these panel sessions, titled 'Leading from the Front,' featured local product leaders such as Funto Akinbeshin, Senior Product Manager at Spotify; Princess Edo-Osagie, Product Leader at Interswitch Group; Anthony Isichei, Senior Product Manager at Pagatech Limited; Temi Giwa, Product Lead at Paystack Nigeria; and Zainab Arilesere, Product Leader at Omnibiz Africa. They shared their journeys into product management, their approaches to guiding and communicating with teams, and the qualities they seek when hiring, which they identified as curiosity, problem-solving skills, grit, and effective communication. Marina Lauchengco delivered an in-depth keynote titled 'How Africa Can Become a Superpower.' She shared insights on how to build great products and dispelled product myths, and gave call, saying that the time is ripe for Africa to build and ascend the ladder. Speaking to reporters at the conference, Emmanuel Idiodi who is also the founder of WorkNigeria said that Marty Cagan's new book should be out by March 2024. The book will discuss how companies can transform to operate like the best companies in the world. Idiodi also had advice for people starting out or planning to start in the tech world. He said, 'Tell people to practice problem-solving; practice it in your everyday life. If you're not good at solving problems, you won't be good at solving problems with technology. So, I say you don't need permission to solve problems. For people starting their journey, I encourage them to volunteer and find a company that is addressing the problems in their lives. Start your own company; it is the fastest way to learn what we do in product development.' Christian also expressed his fascination with Africa's potential, stating, 'Somebody asked me the other day how only 25 percent of Africa is on the internet. I replied, "We created seven unicorns from the few people who discovered the internet." Imagine when 30 to 50 percent of Africa discovers the internet. I am fascinated by what we have achieved without the ability to use modern technology. I look forward to what we will accomplish when we all work together using modern technology to solve problems. I am eager for us to change the landscape of all our problems, including healthcare, unemployment, work in Nigeria, online job opportunities, food, electricity—using technology to accelerate the solutions.' He added that the government needs to provide an enabling environment for technology to succeed. Marty Cagan spoke about the scarcity of talent in the tech market: 'There's a real shortage of talent in the tech market. I'm from San Francisco. It's so hard to find people because it's so expensive to live there. Most people can't afford to live there and work there. So, we've faced a talent shortage. We need talent. We do a lot in China, India, and Europe. There are many talented individuals in Nigeria without jobs. The idea is to help Nigerians get better jobs and also empower them to create products, be it for Nigerians or global companies like Google.' He clarified that SVPG doesn't fund businesses but provides training and consulting services. According to Cagan, they work with senior leaders and the entire company, not just product managers. In closing, Cagan expressed hope for the tech community in Nigeria to accelerate rapidly, and he acknowledged Christian and his team's efforts to develop the tech community. Princess Edo-Osagie from Interswitch expressed satisfaction with the Inspire Africa Conference, citing that their expectations were exceeded by 200%. She said one of their goals was to train a group of people from work simultaneously, and they were able to accomplish this objective. Edo-Osagie also commented on the importance of events like the Inspire Africa Conference. She stated that such events provide companies, like hers, with the opportunity to learn and develop innovative solutions to the numerous problems that exist in Africa.
UPDATED: 17 platforms to learn programming in Nigeria (2023) In a rapidly evolving work landscape, tech skills like programming continue to top the list of highly demanded careers globally. The search for skilled programmers and software developers has never been higher, and Nigeria, with its burgeoning youth population and growing tech ecosystem, is no exception to this trend. The edtech space, particularly those platforms focused on training for technical skills, has experienced significant changes over the last decade. New platforms have emerged, some have evolved, and others have unfortunately ceased operations. Here's an updated list of current opportunities for learning programming in Nigeria. Whether you're a beginner looking to dip your toes into the world of coding or a seasoned developer aiming to upskill, this list offers a range of options to suit your needs.

List as of 2017 (Operational status) Andela (Changed business model to talent management and outsourcing) Andela is an accelerator that trains Africans to become world class software developers within the space of 4 years. The interesting thing is that they will pay you while you are learning. Andela was one of the first to take the bull by the horn by addressing the issue of a developer dearth in Nigeria and other African cities; Nairobi and Uganda. However, there is a general misconception that freshers are accepted into Andela to learn programming without any prior knowledge of coding. This is true and untrue at the same time. Applicants are offered a home-study course that basically details introduction to software development. This is intended to help newbies get a feel of the program before getting in. But considering that the time provided to assimilate the material is too short for an actual newbie, it may be best to go through the self-tutoring route for a bit before applying to Andela. Andela fellows cannot leave before a 2-year period of the general 4 years of training. Actually, it is assumed that it will take 2 years to pay back the cost of training ($15,000), so a contract is drawn up to deduct the balance if you leave before 2 years is up. If you leave after 18 months you only owe 1/4th and after 2 years (24 months), you owe nothing and are free to go. Andela’s application opens and closes through the year in windows called Cycles. The current Cycle closes on the 10th of March 2017. Switch (may no longer be operational) Switch is one of the newest additions to ICT education and software development in Nigeria. Focused on “[tech] talent discovery, acceleration and placement”, Switch appears like an Andela of sorts, except they are different in many ways. Where Andela offers a 4-year training and retainership, the Switch Fellowship runs for 1 year and 3 months -- 3 months of intensive training followed by a 12-month placement in companies where fellows further their skills and build portfolios while getting paid. Located in the heart of Yaba, fellows at the academy get free lunch everyday and stipends to cover transportation and accommodation. Admission into the Switch Academy for the 3-month intensive training is free, applicants only have to be “smart and talented”. After the 3-month period, a percentage of their salaries is deducted over the 1-year placement period. Considering the prerequisites, the Switch fellowship is not for you if you do not have a prior knowledge of coding skills. Moat Academy (Operational) Moat Academy wants "to bridge the gap between the academics and the [tech] industry by making many unemployed [persons] to become employable applicants". Based in Lagos, Moat Academy claims to train developers from 'any background' to inculcate globally acceptable best practices. Applicants go through a 10-week intensive bootcamp which involves project-based tutorials. Regardless of its intensity, the training period is short. However, Moat Academy has adopted a hands-on approach to its training methods. Participants are made to work 7 straight hours everyday and commit to an extra 4 hours at home. Application for Moat Academy's last cohort ended in February, but you can check on the website for the date of intake for the next cohort. Projaro (Operational) Projaro is a startup located in Abuja that recruits trains and empowers software engineers to become “world class” in 1 year. If you are around the Abuja area or Northern Nigeria in general, Projaro is for you. Even though it was originally open to applications from intending software developers with zero skills, Projaro now admits to preferring applicants with a basic knowledge of programming. After applying to join the fellowship, successful applicants will pass through a week-long boot camp which will be the final decider. The Projaro Fellowship is very much hands-on with in-depth projects, tutorials, webinars and workshops for the fellows through the period of the training. For the 3 months, fellows will be trained in the aspects of software development and technical leadership, and the next 3-month period will be dedicated to real projects that may include personal projects. During the last 6 months of the Projaro fellowship, the fellows will be paid for working on clients’ project remotely, full time or part time, depending on their choosing. Sevocoder (Operational) With a goal to "catch them young", Sevocoder is an initiative of the nHub in Jos, Plateau State targeted at secondary school students. The program aims to produce 2,000 developers from Plateau state in a few years time by teaching children and young adults how to code. Targeting young school children was a plan to bridge the skill gap in technology especially programming. Currently, Sevocoder enrols its applicants solely from secondary schools in Jos. However, there are plans to extend the programme to individuals and parents who wish to enrol their children in the program very soon. If you live around Jos and are interested in Sevocoder, contact the nHub. Relearn by CcHub (Operational) This is a program by the Co-Creation Hub targeted at children and teenagers from between 5 - 18 years of age in Primary 1 to SS3 classes. Relearn by CcHub uses technology to enhance education, teaching youngsters basic software engineering, software development and coding skills. The programmes are not free; they cost from between ₦25,000 to ₦55,000. Weekend Club; As the name implies, the Weekend Club is a 2-hour class on Saturdays for 5 to 18 year-olds who do not have time during the week. The program runs for 6 weeks. After-School Club; On Tuesdays and Thursdays, students in Primary 1 to SS3 get to spend a 1-hour period at the club learning computer game design and animation, coding, web page design and programme electronics. Gap Year Club; This is designed for students during the 1-year period before university and after secondary school. They get to learn basic web development and programming. Students are taken into the programme on a quarterly basis. Registration for the first quarter of 2017 is currently closed. However, if you are interested or have a child who is, you can enter them into the cohort for next quarter. Registrations will begin in April. Swap Space Systems (May no longer be operational) The description on its website reads; " [We] Engineer you to take on developer or designer roles in top companies across Africa and beyond. All we require from you is an hunger for knowledge and we'll help you become an expert at doing what you love" Headquartered in the Maryland area of Lagos State, Swap Space offers 3 months intensive training in immersive web development, user experience and Java programming. To apply, you have to pay a non-refundable fee of ₦10,000 which will not included in your final tuition fees. Ocean Digits Academy (May no longer be operational) Ocean Digits Academy is a Lagos-based web and software development training academy that aims to 'to support the steady growth of the technology ecosystem by providing world-class talents for technology companies in Nigeria'. Ocean Digits offers 4 weeks courses each in Basic, Intermediate, Advanced I and Advanced II web development. Tuition fees for the courses are from ₦40,000 -- ₦60,000 and according to the website, the offers come with paid 3-month internship when you become a certified full stack developer. LearnFactory (Operational) Most coding schools are located in Lagos or Abuja and other metropolis, but LearnFactory located in Aba is looking to change this trend. The code school is looking to groom and export "creators and software craftsmen" in the South East. Developers begin their journey at LearnFactory by undergoing a free (not free initially) 3-month intensive bootcamp. ElitePath (Operational) Located in the Port Harcourt the famed city of oil and politics, elitePath is a software company that saw a need and gap in the technology sector in Port Harcourt and decided to bridge the gap by training developers from ground zero to industry standard. ElitePath has a 12-Week Full Stack Web Development course where students learn web technologies from the core; HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL, JavaScript etc. Classes are in session on Tuesday - Thursday 9am-12noon and 1pm-4pm daily. According to the ElitePath website, the full course costs ₦90,000. Self tutoring One common trend with fellowships that exist in Nigeria today is that most of them do not give opportunities to people who want to learn programming without any prior knowledge. The ones that do still have a high preference and bias for a previous knowledge of the topic, no matter how small. You can actually teach yourself to code without leaving the confines of your bedroom or signing any contracts with anybody. All you need to make this happen is an internet connection and a computer (preferably a laptop). The path to learning software development is rough and paved with stones. But according to the experts, to be a self-taught software developer determination, grit and the ability to keep on learning are qualities that should be imbibed and developed. Software development is an expansive field, figuring out what part actually interests you will be a good place to start. Some resources to get started include; Codeacademy, Khan Academy, Treehouse, Udemy, PluralSight, Udacity, StackOverflow, Coursera, Github, W3 Schools, Free Code Camp, FutureLearn, Developer groups and communities on social media. Fashion photographer Herb Ritts said “many people who excel are self taught”. It all ties in with the fact that being self-taught gives you a wider perspective. While you’re trying to learn programming on your own, READ everything, WATCH VIDEOS and GOOGLE away anything you do not understand.

This innovative LibertyPay digitization of Ajo, an age-long thrift collection and micro-savings system in Nigeria is set to uplift communities, foster financial inclusion, change lives while ensuring a digitized system that is in tune with modernity. According to Igbene Otimeyin, Chief Executive Officer of LibertyPay, with the Ajo innovation, the company sees over 150 percent increase in seamless savings collections by traditional thrift collectors from Ajo participants, a more streamlined, accessible and transparent system and a secure financial resilience aimed at transforming the lives of Nigerians. “Traditional Ajo system have long been a cornerstone of informal micro-savings and thrift collection fostering trust and community cohesion. However, these age-old practices have been in need of a digital makeover to keep pace with the modern world. LibertyPay seizes this opportunity in partnership with industry players to usher in a new era of financial inclusion and empowerment that will not only streamline the savings process but also ensure financial transparency and accountability by all parties,” Otimeyin explained. He continued that, “specifically, we are empowering Ajo collectors with over 1,000 Point of Sale machines simply accessible by dialing *347*180*4#. These devices empower collectors to seamlessly manage contributions and withdrawals, eliminating the need for cumbersome bookkeeping. With these collectors facilitating the transition to digital Ajo, we anticipate a digital thrift collection of N5 billion monthly or an impressive $5.5 million. This colossal shift is set to supercharge the financial inclusion of Nigeria's informal sector.” Meanwhile, LibertyPay has announced Nosiru Sonoiki as the company’s new Chief Operating Officer. Nosiru has consistently demonstrated exceptional dedication and a remarkable ability to forge critical partnerships during his tenure, particularly as the Head of Agency Banking and Business Development. In his new role, Nosiru Sonoiki will be leading the effort to scale LibertyPay’s digital Ajo product with all the deliverables. As LibertyPay continues to innovate, it's worth noting that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recognized its potential early in the game, awarding it an AIP under the supernatant category in January 2023. This heralds a promising future for LibertyPay as it charts new territories in the realm of financial inclusion for Nigerians.

Previously known for its data visualization and consulting offerings, Statisense has made a strategic move into Artificial intelligence, capitalizing on the growing opportunity globally. General Data Landscape One of the biggest challenges Africa faces is its inability to organize and present its data in a way that decisions can be made quickly by businesses, governments and consumers. Consequently, if wholly adopted, Generative and Analytical AI presents an equalizing effect to bring Africa at par with the rest of the world, transforming various sectors with data innovation across consumer landscapes like healthcare, finance, identity, markets, education, and more.

If Statisense is able to pull this off, it will mark a significant milestone in the evolution of data analytics and AI on the continent, empowering businesses to achieve new levels of insight-driven success. In closing, Femi also reiterates that despite its AI transition, Statisense remains committed to continuing its freemium macroeconomic insights service through its social channels. “It is what got us here in the first place, and our improved AI platform will only help deliver more on our data service to consumers”.

Leatherback Launches Money Transfer App for Africans in the Diaspora Picture a world where sending money across borders is as easy as sending a text message. That's right, no more endless paperwork, no more exorbitant fees, and no more waiting for days before the funds land in a recipient’s account. Sounds like a dream, doesn't it? But what if this isn't a dream anymore, but a reality fashioned by Leatherback - a dynamic tech player, changing the stressful modalities of cross-border payments into simple and accessible modalities, for Africans across the globe. And Leatherback just launched a mobile app designed to turn this dream into a practical, everyday convenience for students, medical migrants, remote workers, freelancers, parents, and business owners. Leatherback, a cross-border payment platform founded in 2019, simplifies cross-border payments for Africans by providing remittance and multi-currency solutions for everyone to send and receive money quickly without restrictions. Inspired by the Leatherback turtle, the CEO and Co-founder, Toyeeb Ibrahim, imagined a world where money could travel as freely and easily as the Leatherback turtle did. The Leatherback turtle is the largest and most migratory of all sea turtles, spanning multiple continents. The leatherback turtle swims around the globe, crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and travelling across Alaska, Norway, New Zealand, South America, and South Africa. It spans borders and is resilient enough to withstand vast temperature changes. Unlike that turtle, money cannot travel as freely. Challenges such as location, exchange rates, finding trusted finance partners, high transaction fees, and many more hinder people from attaining their desired lives. Then came Leatherback – the solution. Like that turtle, Leatherback Finance is resilient and borderless. It aims to provide everyone with access to services that enable them to become genuinely global, experiencing the taste of absolute financial freedom. Leatherback understands the pain points of cross-border payments and has worked tirelessly to develop a mobile app that allows everyone to instantly send and receive money in any currency of their choice. Students can pay tuition fees, migrants can use the Leatherback app to sort out their payments, and remote workers and freelancers can also use the Leatherback mobile app to get paid in any currency they choose. The Leatherback mobile app boasts a sleek, intuitive, and easy-to-navigate interface, designed with the end user in mind. The straightforward onboarding process allows users to create an account in two minutes, eliminating the tedious paperwork. Notably, the Leatherback mobile app has a range of features that ensure a streamlined and secure currency transfer experience. Key features of the app include: SendR: A Leatherback remittance product that enables individuals to send funds in their local currency, and the beneficiary will instantly receive the funds in the currency of their choice, be it in NGN, ZAR, TZS, CFA, XAF, XOF, GHS, GBP, USD and many more. Multi-currency account: Individuals can own a multi-currency account to quickly process transactions, and deposit and withdraw funds in various currencies. Interestingly, users can transfer funds between sub-accounts or convert currency as needed, often at a preferential exchange rate compared to regular currency conversion fees. Daily rates and negotiation: Individuals in the diaspora can access daily rates for each currency and negotiate the rates that suit them. Their negotiations are considered, while Leatherback ensures the offered rate works. Instant transfers: Through advanced technology and strategic partnerships with banking networks, Leatherback enables instant fund transfers, empowering recipients with swift access to funds when needed. As part of its commitment to cross-border payments, Leatherback is authorised by notable regulated bodies to ensure that the Leatherback mobile app is accessible to users in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania, and other African countries. This inclusivity aligns with the company's mission of creating a global community where barriers to financial transactions are dismantled. Toyeeb Ibrahim, CEO of Leatherback, expressed his excitement about the app's launch, stating, "We are proud to introduce our mobile app to empower Africans in the diaspora by providing solutions tailored to their cross-border payment needs. We love the idea of accessing 15+ currencies and transacting across 21 countries on the go, without physically visiting a bank". Leatherback's mobile app represents a significant step towards a more interconnected world, where financial barriers are torn down, and individuals have the power to connect, support, and thrive across borders. In addition to focusing on efficient remittance services, Leatherback plans to integrate additional financial solutions in the future, further solidifying its commitment to providing individuals with the fastest cross-border payments. To get started on the Leatherback app, download the app on Play Store and App Store. Visit www.leatherback.co to learn more.

Co-founder of $4bn OneCoin scam jailed When was the last time you used Threads? Well, for me, it's been weeks since I visited the X (Twitter) copycat. I tried to keep up but I forgot all about it at some point. It is no surprise that it lost 20% of daily active users weeks after gaining a record-breaking 100 million users in five days. However, a quotes feature might be coming to the platform soon. The Head of Threads and Instagram, Adam Mosseri, posted on Threads that he just tested the feature and it will be rolling out soon. I don't want to be a pessimist, but Threads will need to do a lot more than "quotes" to get people using Threads daily. For today's newsletter, we're discussing: The $4 billion scam coin A cybersecurity regulation created by Kenyan citizens Co-founder of $4 billion scam coin sentenced to 20 years in prison One of the co-founders of OneCoin, a crypto scam coin that defrauded 3.5 million people of $4 billion has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Sebastian Greenwood has been detained in the US since 2018 when he was arrested in Thailand for promoting OneCoin. What is OneCoin? OneCoin was many things to many people. You could call it a movement, a scheme, or even a religion, but it was most certainly a scam. Here's the gist: A group of fraudsters came together in 2014 to create what they touted as the next Bitcoin. Leading this team of advanced fraudsters "the Cryptoqueen", Dr Ruja Ignatova. Ignatova designed a scam so simple, yet so effective. OneCoin was sold in the form of educational packages. The deception was that once you buy them, you got a chance to receive OneCoin when it launches. Unfortunately, there was no token, there wasn't even a blockchain to begin with. You can even say the scam was not crypto-related because there was no sale of digital currencies. Why did people fall for it? Ignatova had the credentials to back her deception. She is a PhD holder, an Oxford University graduate, and a former McKinsey employee. However, her biggest weapon was people's greed. Where's Ignatova now? Lost in the wind. The FBI has been searching for "the Cryptoqueen" since 2017. Kenyan citizens will participate in the creation of the country's cybersecurity regulation Kenya's National Computer and Cybercrimes Coordination Committee (NC4), is seeking the input of the country's citizens in the creation of a cybersecurity regulation. NC4 is a body operating under the State Department of Internal Security and National Administration. The regulation will create a comprehensive framework for how Kenya detects and responds to cybersecurity threats. How will the public participate in the creation of the regulation? According to Raymond Omollo, Interior Principal Secretary, both physical and virtual meetings will be held in eight regions across Kenya. NC4 will also conduct meetings with stakeholders from different sectors that may be impacted by the regulation. Some of the sectors include energy, manufacturing, finance, and transportation.
Paychant – Powering Africa's Fiat-to-Crypto Gateway Paychant, Africa's fiat-to-crypto on and off-ramp solution, serves as the bridge that connects Africa's traditional finance and digital assets. In less than 6 months since its launch, it's processing over twenty thousand transactions monthly, eliminating the complexity for people in Africa to onboard into digital currency. Over the years, people in Africa have shown a great interest in digital assets mostly because of their benefit of hedging against currency inflation and transferring money cheaply. However, the complexity of acquiring crypto assets has been an obstacle for many users in Africa, and this has made it extremely difficult for digital wallets and dApps to onboard mainstream users in Africa. 6 months ago, we launched the Paychant ramp solution to offer a simple yet intuitive platform for people in Africa to transition from fiat currency into digital currency right inside any digital wallet or dApps of their choice. Paychant prides itself as Africa's first and leading fiat-to-crypto on and off-ramp solution and remains committed to making digital currency accessible to a wider audience in Africa. We have partnered with digital wallets like Cenoa, Hurupay, and Flooz, acting as their fiat-to-crypto on and off-ramp providers in Africa and experiencing 100% month-on-month growth in both user base and transaction volume. "Our ramp solution mainly focuses on Africa, supporting a wider range of local payment methods, allowing users to seamlessly buy and sell crypto with local bank transfer and mobile money, which are the most recognized and preferred methods of payment on the continent." The founders explained. "Wallets and dApps looking to enter the African market can now take advantage of Paychant's localized payment infrastructure, which offers low fees, reduced friction, and lower minimum crypto purchases. Our fiat on-and-off ramp customizable widget can be embedded directly into any wallet, dApp, DEX, or NFT platform with just a few lines of code. Paychant handles the compliance, and the entire fiat and crypto flow, so wallet providers can focus on their main business." Support for Multichain Paychant supports 45+ crypto assets on major blockchain networks like Ethereum, Celo, Polygon, Binance, Solana, Tron, Cardano, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, and the Bitcoin network. Our Coverage Our service is available in most of the biggest crypto markets in Africa, supporting all local payment methods for on-ramp and off-ramp in each of these regions: Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia. Wallet and dApp that integrates Paychant will enable their users in these regions to buy and sell 45+ crypto via the listed local payment method: Safaricom M-PESA, MTN Mobile Money (MoMo), AirtelTigo, Vodafone cash, Zamtel, Airtel money, Bank transfer and Orange Money. Our mission is to connect Africa's traditional finance and the decentralized finance world, giving the people in Africa equal access to the financial benefits and opportunities of Web3. We are very excited about the future of Web3, and we are ready to make crypto onboarding easy for the next billion users in Africa. If you are interested in integrating our fiat on/off ramp into your app, please reach out to us here, and we will get back to you as soon as we can.
The Next Phase of CinderBuild as a Marketplace Leader in the Construction Space Cinder Build was launched with a vision to bring about a seamless buying experience in the real estate and construction space. Our business model on the supply side is hinged on solid partnerships with major manufacturers which gives us an enviable catalog of building materials at very competitive prices (We actually prefer the word unbeatable). We deliver this value on the demand side through our digital platform to two user segments; Resellers (C-stores) and Corporate buyers Initially, we focused on catering to the needs of the reseller segment. However, as time went on, we recognized the opportunity to establish dedicated offline distribution channels known as C-stores, stemming from our existing reseller user base. These C-stores, consisting of resellers who make substantial weekly bulk purchases, have become an integral part of our business. To alleviate the capital procurement challenges associated with restocking, we have implemented an automated system that ensures these C-stores receive restocks at least twice a week. As a result, they have become invaluable distribution partners for us. Presently, our network boasts over 1500 C-stores and continues to grow. We have evolved as a business in line with data based feedback and insights gained from our interaction with key real estate and construction players, working with their procurement teams on their project. We developed Builder 360™, an all-in-one product suite to cater for this segment. The Builder 360™ suite is an interconnected web of value-added solutions and services, made available to customers based on platform loyalty. For every amount spent on the platform, eligibility increases and at certain spend thresholds, users unlock a new solution typically addressing critical pain areas. With Builder 360™, you get access to cutting-edge solutions that allow you outsmart inflation, store project materials virtually for future use. It doesn't end there, you have access to inventory management tools, project financing, access to vetted artisans, visibility across board and much more. Users can unlock the various solutions based on their rank within the community and they move up the rank as they hit transaction volume milestones. Furthermore, the emergence of online marketplaces and procurement platforms like CinderBuild has made it easier for builders to source and purchase construction materials, equipment, and services. With CinderBuild's Cloud Warehouse solution, for instance, builders can store materials virtually and receive on-demand piecewise site deliveries, reducing the need for physical storage space and eliminating the risk of theft or damage. We are proud to currently serve a robust client base of corporates across the Real estate and construction space. As a trendsetting organization, with a steadfast focus on reshaping the building materials procurement industry landscapes, our journey with our corporate clients in the real estate and construction space has ignited an unprecedented wave of innovation leading to the birth of Nigeria’s first credit Mortgage Card. We are issuing salary-backed mortgage loans to Nigeria's working class allowing them to make down payments and installmental payments on exclusive real estate properties listed by our esteemed corporates. By doing this, salary earners are now well equipped to confidently explore the real estate market and secure their dream homes with ease. Upon the successful acquisition of a property by a salary earner, the funds are transferred to our secure escrow system. Simultaneously, corporates have access to these funds, enabling them to procure high quality building materials for their construction projects from CinderBuild. This seamless integration streamlines the entire process, eliminating delays, and enhancing the efficiency of property development. By empowering corporates with the financial resources to procure superior building materials, we are catalyzing a transformative change in the construction industry. The properties developed through our platform boast enhanced durability and quality materials, elevating the overall living experience for homeowners. This virtuous cycle fosters a reputation of excellence for corporates, attracting more potential buyers and creating a positive impact in the real estate market. Owning a mortgage account with cinderbuild is simple and hassle-free. Homeowners can easily link their mortgage accounts to the card, allowing for direct payments and better visibility of mortgage-related transactions. Every financial transaction is meticulously tracked and recorded, ensuring complete visibility for both salary earners and corporates. For us at CinderBuild, beyond the bottom line and the excitement of deploying a rapidly adopted technology solution, we are peeling back layer by layer the depth of value in tech enabled procurement and delivering this value to a fast growing user base in one of the largest construction markets in the world. As we begin our next phase, we are tapping into the depth of learnings from launching in a robust market like Nigeria, and leveraging that to build locally-adapted digital products as we launch swiftly into more African countries. We see ourselves as an innovation leader in this space, as our teams are drawn from some of the most reputable institutions in the world, and backed by top-tier VCs from across Europe and the U.S. Whether you're building roads, bridges, housing estates, commercial buildings in the private and public sector, Builder 360™ has everything you need to take your construction projects and business to the next level.
