Nigerian, Oluseyi Akindeinde, Secures Patent for Blockchain-driven Authentication System Hyperspace Technologies Limited has secured a patent for Blockchain technology-driven Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Developed within the Hyperspace Technologies’ research and development (R&D) division, cipherKEY tap2sign™ MFA is a next-generation security system designed to leverage the decentralized nature of blockchain, the robustness of public/ private key cryptography, and the convenience of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to provide an unprecedented level of security against identity theft, phishing, and social engineering attacks Dr. Oluseyi Akindeinde has been credited as the inventor of this MFA that is poised to enhance a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity. The patent application was officially filed on June 22, 2023, and the patent certificate, sighted by our reporter, indicates that it was granted on August 28, 2023. In the age of digital transformation, security is paramount. As individuals, businesses and nations increasingly rely on digital platforms for everything from banking to social networking, the need for robust security measures has never been more critical. One such measure is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity. Today, Hyperspace Limited has introduced cipherKEYtap2sign™, a groundbreaking MFA technology that leverages the security of public/private keys, blockchain, Web3 technology, and contactless Near Field Communication (NFC) cards. It utilizes the concept of "proof of possession" and a fourth factor of authentication - "something you do".
In the case of cipherKEY tap2sign™, "something you have" is the cipherKEY NFC card, and "something you do" is the action of tapping the cipherKEY NFC card against your phone. This unique combination of factors makes thetap2sign™ system incredibly secure and user-friendly. Before securing the patent, the Blockchain technology-driven MFA was subjected to rigorous reviews and tests. Dr. Akindeinde’s inspiration for creating this MFA stemmed from his advocacies for blockchain technology-driven authentication processes. “In a world where our digital identities are increasingly under threat, where a single misstep can compromise your entire network, where every transaction we make leaves us vulnerable, we understand your concern. We understand the sleepless nights. And that's why we've spent years developing cipherKEYtap2sign™ MFA - your ironclad solution to security threats. “Imagine a wall. A wall so high and so robust, nothing unauthorized can get over it, under it, or through it. That wall is the cipherKEY tap2sign™ MFA, and we've designed it to protect what matters most to you - your identity, your data, your peace of mind”, he said.
Hackers use Ethereum founder's X account to steal $691k Hello guys, today's Techpoint Digest will be coming from me, Bolu, as your usual host, Victoria, is under the weather. The fall of FTX, a $32 billion crypto exchange, was one of the worst things to happen to crypto. The man responsible for FTX's fall — Sam Bankman-Fried — wants to get out of jail because he says the Internet in the federal jail he is in is bad. His lawyers say he needs a pre-trial release because they need a fast Internet connection to prepare a good defence for him. Turns out he was promised access to a laptop every weekday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., a man responsible for traded and lost customer funds worth billions of dollars. Anyway, today we're discussing: How hackers stole $691k with Ethereum founder's X account. Interswitch now supports Google Pay. Flutterwave wants to solve Nigeria's FX problems.
Hackers steal $691k with Ethereum founder's X account Vitalik Buterin, the founder of blockchain network, Ethereum was a victim of a social media hack that led to the theft of $691,000. Hackers gained access to his X (formerly Twitter) account, on Saturday, September 9, 2023, and posted phishing links seen by his 4.9 million followers. Unfortunately, some people clicked the link that was disguised as a free non-fungible token (NTF). When they connected their wallets to mint the NFT, their crypto balance was drained. This isn't the first time hackers are using popular X accounts to steal crypto. In 2020, an 18-year old was able to hack the X accounts of prominent figures like former US President, Barack Obama, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk and, Microsoft Founder, Bill Gates. The hacker solicited funds from the public, promising to double whatever they sent. He was, however, caught and sentenced to three years in jail. Interswitch now supports Google Pay
Google Pay is now a payment option on the Interswitch Payment Gateway (IPG). Interswitch made the announcement today, September 11, 2023, saying businesses and individuals in Nigeria will benefit from the "simplicity and security of contactless payments and digital storage." What does this mean? This means you don't have to go through the hassle of typing your ATM card details whenever you want to make an online payment through IPG. How does it work? Google Pay basically saves your card details and provides an easy way for you to authenticate online transactions. For example, I already have my card details on Google Pay, so anytime I need to pay for a new gun on Call of Duty, I just confirm payment with my fingerprint. It gets even more advanced. In some countries, you can simply tap your phone (which has Google Wallets) or smart wearable device against a near field communication (NFC) PoS to pay for things. Interswitch isn't the first to do this.
Paystack also introduced pay with Apple Pay back in 2021, which allows iPhone users to pay conveniently with Face ID. Flutterwave's solution to Nigeria's FX problems Flutterwave has launched Swap, its answer to Nigeria's FX problems. Swap was launched on September 4, 2023. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is backing it as the digital platform where Nigerians can have immediate access to foreign currency at competitive exchange rates. Flutterwave launched the product in partnership with Wema Bank and a Bureau de Change (BDC) called Kadavra. These partners will provide the tech company with liquidity. Swap will also start rolling out cards that can be used by Nigerians who need quick access to personal travel allowance and business travel allowance. It said it plans to distribute more than 10 million cards to Nigerians starting October this year.

Meet Olumide Olusanya, a former medical doctor who quit the practice to sell groceries online Olumide Olusanya is Chief 'Glootian' at Gloo.ng, a pioneering online grocery business based in Lagos or Sparta, depending on how you choose to see it. You can hardly miss all the references to Sparta strategically placed all around the Gloo.ng office in Lekki, Lagos Island. One particular inscription reads: Heads down; Ignore the noise. Stay hungry, stay focused. Keep shipping. THIS ... IS ... SPARTA!!! The philosophy is evident in the way Olusanya runs his company -- Gloo.ng is the pioneer in Nigerian eCommerce you probably never heard about before now. "We don't make noise" Olusanya tells us, "we focus more on the product and the customer".
What follows is an amazing story of how Olusanya quit a promising career in Medicine to eventually become Nigeria's first, and probably only, technical eCommerce Founder. Múyìwá Mátùlúkò of Techpoint Africa (MM): How did a fully practising Medical Doctor end up in tech? Olumide "D.O" Olusanya of Gloo.ng (DO): I graduated from the College of Medicine, University of Lagos (UNILAG) in 1993. I never wanted to study medicine - my dad forced me. So I was always looking for how to do something relating to my passion, which is technology. I practised as a Trauma Doctor at the Lagos State Emergency Medical Services. Once, one of the sons to the owner of Glendora Bookshop, came to the hospital to deliver his baby. I got to find out he was into tech, so I asked him if I could come over and learn from him whenever I was free. That's where I got familiar with the concept of relational databases. Microsoft Access was readily available to me then but, when I learnt Oracle was the best, I decided I wanted to be an Oracle Database Administrator.
I got books and studied by myself. I totally smashed my certification exams. That's one of the gifts I have — I can read anything, any knowledge that is written in a book, and the level of depth of understanding I get from it would be better than the person that wrote it. After I got my certification, I got a friend of mine, Dr. Ojo of the Computer Science department in UNILAG , to connect me to an unpaid internship at one of the top Oracle certified partners in the country at the time. That's how I became a doctor by night and Oracle Database Admin by day. This was around 2001. We were working on a project with First Bank at the time and this really gave me an opportunity of getting my hands dirty with real life databases. That's pretty much how I entered tech. MM: At what point did you decide you could comfortably quit medicine to pursue your passion for tech? DO: I met Senator Ayo Arise — he was not a Senator at the time — who came back from the US to found Cards Technology Limited (CTL).
There were no cards in Nigeria by this time asides ValuCard. There were probably only about 10,000 of them at that time. I remember there only 2 ATMs owned by Societe Genrale Bank Nigeria, in Broad Street. Senator Arise painted his vision for electronic payments to me and I latched on to it. I felt like this was something I could actually commit myself to because I knew ultimately that I would quit medicine. The defining moment for me was when I solved a problem that had been struggling with for about a year. Senator Arise had assured me that if I could help resolve the issue, I had the job. Don't forget I was doctor by night and still working my other day job as an Oracle DBA by day. The only time I had left was overnight. The first free night I got I used it.
By the time he came back in the morning, the system was up. That's how I joined CTL. We were a team of 5 and because I was the only the tech person at the time, I was by the default the CTO. One of the first things we did was get our MasterCard certification, all by reading from manuals. This was when I realised payments was going to be big in Nigeria. Within a year we rolled out the first real-time POS solution in Nigeria with First Bank. Within another year, we rolled out West Africa's first international payments card — the Ecobank Mastercard. Interswitch was just starting around this time, but with a focus on local. CTL is pretty much where I cut my teeth. Within 4 or 5 years, I became the CEO at CTL.
I was there for 7 years. But I and the founder had a few differences so I resigned as CEO to join Tony Elumelu at UBA, where I helped turnaround their card business. MM: And I'm guessing that's when the idea for Gloo.ng came? DO: 6 years before UBA, I had read Warren Buffett's biography, "The making of an American Capitalist". The book left an impression on me, so much so that I made up my mind that I was going to retire into Investment Management. So whenever I had free time at home, I was studying and running V-Squared Capital, my private Investment Management outfit, on the side. By the time I decided to leave UBA, V-Squared Capital was already giving me twice the cash flow I was getting at UBA. This gave me enough comfort to be able to quit UBA. I was 39 when I decided to retire. The idea was I was never going to work again in my life.
I just studied annual reports at home and took positions in the stock market. As at early 2012 this was what I was still doing this. What this gave me is an opportunity, for the first time, to understand how exactly my wife lived her own life. Prior to that time, as a typical white collar executive, I would leave early in the morning and come back home late at night. My wife was an SAP consultant so she did a lot travelling. I am totally useless at home keeping so, any time she was around, rather than sitting down spending time with the family, she spent most of her free time keeping the home. Particularly stocking groceries from the supermarket, cooking, and freezing food. I didn't think anyone should be spending their lives this way. There had to be a way technology could make this easier. I took out the settees in the sitting room, called a carpenter to build shelves and then went to Oke Arin market to by products to stock the shelves.
Then I came up with a very small website. Our website went up on the 30th of June, 2012. The next day, July 1st, Konga.com launched. Sabunta and Kasuwa (now merged as Jumia.com.ng) launched around that same time too. We were only catering to the Magodo community where we lived at the time. I did most of the picking, packing and delivery myself. My wife would assist in her free time, and I had one person join us at a point but he left after 2 months. Nevertheless, the feedback we got was impressive. Studying and reading further about trends in eCommerce, I realised that there couldn't have been a better time to start an eCommerce business in Nigeria than then. I sold off some of the equity and assets from V-Squared Capital.
It was more like the seed fund for Gloo.ng. As things got more serious, we moved to our first office in Lekki. We believed that was the place with the more potential market. This was in September of 2012. We had 2 drivers join us. Then I asked my wife to resign from her job and join me, to which she obliged. I and my wife did the picking and packing while the drivers did the delivery. MM: By the way, how did you come up with the name Gloo? DO: Interestingly, we started off as buycommonthings.com. We wanted a name that people would see and immediately get an idea of what we possibly could be selling.
However, it soon became clear we needed to change our name. Especially after we met with a VC who was looking to setup in Nigeria. She kept hammering about changing the name. One morning, about a week after meeting with the VC, I was having a bath when it occurred to me that the name should be "Glue". One of the things we had seen clearly from running the business for 9 months at the time was that we were having a lot of return customers because we seemed to have a "Glue Effect" on them. But it wouldn't make sense if we were to use "glue" as the name of a website that sells things that people want to consume, it just didn't make sense. So we thought we'd use the homophone — Gloo. 80% of our revenue comes from repeat business. MM: So how has Gloo grown over the years from the humble beginnings of serving just people in Magodo? DO: Our decision to move from the gated community in Magodo to Lekki was guided by the philosophy that Lekki represents the biggest gated community in the country.
It is also the one with the highest per capita income. This for us was the sweet spot of our target market. Then we spread from Lekki estate to cover the whole of Lekki. Then we moved on to V/I, Ikoyi, the whole of Lagos Island and now the whole of Lagos, except Badagry and Epe, for obvious reasons. Our first office in Lekki was about 5000 square-feet. Our current space is 4 times of that. But we are already looking to move to a bigger space before the end of this year. We are not trying to be everything to everybody, like Jumia and Konga are. We are a supermarket, we have a clear idea of the kind of products people expect to find in a supermarket. So rather than trying to widen our selection, in terms of categories, what we want to do is deepen.
But not to cater to every whim and taste. The idea for Gloo is to stock anything you need to take care of your family, your home and yourself. So you'll find food and drinks, home appliances, kitchen utensils and the like. MM: What would you say was a major determinant in Gloo.ng's exponential growth? DO: When we started, we didn't have much cash. In hindsight, it was more of a blessing than a pain. When you don't have much cash in hand to splash on marketing, you tend to focus more on the product and the customers. That's the foundation of Gloo.ng. We realise that in the long term, there is nothing that's going to make us succeed other than this. If there is any clear competitive advantage we have in this space, it's that nobody understands the customer as much as we do.
So for example, one of the things we didn't do at the start was to allow just anybody register. You had to be willing to pay from day 1 otherwise you couldn't register or do anything on the site. What that allowed us to do was be able to determine whether or not we even had something that people were willing to pay for the service. We also weren't spending any money on marketing. We relied 100% on word-of-mouth. The beautiful thing that we had was that Konga and Jumia were around at the same time. The fact that they were spending money on marketing to educate people, not just about their own brand, but on eCommerce in general, created a good wave for us. Only after we felt that we had a better understanding of who our customers were did we embark on some marketing campaigns. We have a product that really, really works. MM: Most of the eCommerce players have begun to diversify into the marketplace model, as opposed to stocking 100% of the inventory themselves.
We are probably looking at a future of Nigerian eCommerce that will be driven 100% by the marketplace model? What's your take on this? While we don't make any noise about it, Gloo also employs the marketplace model. Our percentage of marketplace is probably more than what others have. When we started at the beginning of the year, 33% of our revenue was coming from marketplace products. We are now at 40%, we should get to 50% before the end of this year. In the long term, we want that to peak at 80%. However, I don't believe anyone can do 100% marketplace in Nigeria, due to the constraints we have as regards the supply chain. Nigeria is not a productive base, as far as manufacturing is concerned. It makes sense to want to minimise the risk of inventory but, as far as Nigeria is concerned, it is always going to be a mix.
There is also a strategic benefit for us in wanting to keep 20% of the inventory. A significant portion of our business is B2B (b2b.gloo.ng). We don't make noise about that either but it exists. But we're more excited to make noise about is the new VIP Membership feature we just launched. MM: You promise same day delivery to your customers. Considering how much of a logistics nightmare Lagos is, how do you manage to keep that promise? DO: Similar to the concept of Product/Market fit, there's also what we call the Entrepreneur/Problem fit. If there's anything that's clear to me, it's that everything I have done in my life has actually been in preparation for this. It's pretty much the same with the team I have with me. I can't go into much detail but I can tell you that we have built a proprietary Address Verification System that allows us to do least-cost route planning.
So before our fulfilment team members leave, they already have a good idea of every place they are going to deliver and which routes to take. MM: How about the challenge of payments? What's your take on Cash on Delivery? I personally feel it needs to die. DO: In as much as payments is a challenge, less than 43% of our transactions are Cash on Delivery and it's easy to see why. I told you 80% of business come from repeat purchases. The products we sell are primarily what people use everyday. As opposed to others in the space who sell things you don't buy everyday, like phones and the like. So while our customers may pay with cash on their first visit, they find it's just more convenient to pay upfront in the long run. However, I don't think you can take Cash on Delivery away from Nigeria until we become a truly cashless society.
It is not a problem of eCommerce. It's a problem of the context of where we are operating. MM: What are the biggest challenges to running an eCommerce business in Nigeria? DO: eCommerce, like they say, is a bear. In Nigeria, it's an angry Grizzly Bear. eCommerce is a very challenging business as it is, irrespective of wherever you are. This is because it's a business that requires scale for you to succeed. You cannot be a successful eCommerce player if you're small. It doesn't matter how many are playing in a certain market, you always see a winner-takes-all. So for example, take a look at the space iROKOtv is playing in, which other entity is actually scratching that space?
We have Konga and Jumia doing general merchandise; after those 2, who else has the space? It's the same with Gloo on the online supermarket space. Another major challenge is the local Nigerian factor. You need generators for power so your cost of running a business is significantly higher. Lastly, running a supermarket business in general is a tough business. I don't think anybody entering this space now can be seen in any form to be sane. Because they will be contending with 3 different things: working in an eCommerce vertical, doing it in Nigeria, and then choosing to do it in the online supermarket space. What has been of benefit for us is the timing with which we came out. Anybody trying to get to where we are now will end up spending about 20 times the money we've spent, and you probably will still not have clawed at it. That's why we've seen a thousand-and-one people enter this space and they've all fallen by the way side.
Anyone with the intention of starting eCommerce now must have a key advantage and tons and loads of money, in the category of the likes of Konga and Jumia. Because it takes a long time for people to change their mind about something they are already used to. You will need to provide a service that is 10 times better than the competition if you want to beat them. According to EuroMonitor report, we currently own 80% of the online supermarket space and we intend to own it forever. We are happy to welcome competition because they make us sit up. But we know the pain is hitting them 10 times as much as it's hitting us. However, in our case we have a lot of things in place with which to cushion the pain. I personally wouldn't encourage anyone to enter the eCommerce space now. Rather, give it about 4 years when the big players would have scaled, growth rate would have peaked and you would better understand their shortcomings. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying anyone shouldn't venture into eCommerce.
My point is that strategically speaking, now is the wrong time to start. You've missed that wave, but a second wave is coming. The best way to position yourself for that is to work for an existing foundation eCommerce company, but not at the scale of Konga and Jumia, because you may never get a real sense of the challenges there. The idea is to get first hand insight into how the system works and how the market is evolving. MM: What advice would you give budding entrepreneurs in general? DO: You need to be prepared. Long before Gloo, I had a bunch of business that failed. But you learn from experiences like that. Working in an existing venture, especially in Nigeria where there is no robust ecosystem like in Silicon Valley, is the best opportunity you have to absorb what entrepreneurship really is. Even better if you could be one of the foundation staff so you can see things first hand.
That's best advice I can give. Work as a foundation staff in an existing venture. Forget all the hype about incubators and accelerators. Nigeria doesn't work like that. MM: What's your long term vision for Gloo? DO: Take a look at Nigeria now in terms of retail development, particularly the supermarket space, in comparison to the US. In the US, they have 80% market share for formal modern retail. That includes brick and mortar stores like Walmart, Target and then eCommerce. eCommerce has only about 5% of the entire market. In the UK it's the same.
In South Africa it's 60%. In Kenya it's 30% for formal modern retail. But when you come to Nigeria, it's just 2%. That's between two primary entities — Park 'n' Shop and Shoprite. What that shows you is that people still prefer to go to their neighbourhood small store. I remember about 2 months ago, I went on my customary competitive scan at one of the huge retail outlets. I bought ₦8000 worth of products but it took me 2 hours 30 minutes to checkout, on a Sunday afternoon. About 1 hour 45 mins of that was spent on the queue itself. But why do people keep going there? Because of the selection that they have.
These guys don't deliberately want to keep people that long. The challenge that they have is they're constrained by brick and mortar. They need to open more stores but, in Nigeria, real estate is very expensive. Because Nigeria wasn't developed with the plan of having big supermarkets like abroad, even if finance was not an issue, getting the suitable location in the first place is a big challenge. Developing it is another challenge. Shoprite for example has been in Nigeria for about 11 years but they have built only 9 stores across the nation. Park 'n' Shop has been here 25 years. It took both of them a combined 25 years to get to 2% marketshare. We've been around just two and a half years, yet we've covered the whole of Lagos. We're going to Abuja next quarter - the demand is still there.
There is a huge gap between what the brick and mortar can scale to and take on that demand and what eCommerce can do. And that's what we see. Our vision is very clear — to become Nigeria’s biggest supermarket. Don’t mix it up. We are already Nigeria’s biggest online supermarket. The race we are running is to be as big as Shoprite and Park n Shop. Shoprite had $400 million revenue in Nigeria last financial year. That’s 4% of their $10 billion group revenue. To be Nigeria’s biggest supermarket, all it takes is to be a Nigerian brand. We are not saying we want to be bigger than Shoprite.
But we will be Nigeria's biggest supermarket, the same way Globacom is Nigeria’s biggest telecoms company. It’s a Nigerian brand started by Nigerians. That’s what Gloo.ng is. That’s the vision

Through this training, we envision a resilient ecosystem of thriving businesses that positively influence the economic landscape. "We are excited to partner with TWPC and UWGN to launch this important initiative. We believe this would go a long way to bridging the skill deficit prevalent among the youths and SMEs. The need for digital skills keeps growing daily, globally, and Nigeria is not exempted. We believe that through this effort, we can uplift communities, transform lives, and contribute to a brighter, more inclusive future," he said. "We are proud to support this initiative, which will help to create a more inclusive and prosperous future for Nigeria," said Dr Moji Olateru-Olagbegi, Chief Executive Officer of TWPC.

"We are committed to helping young people develop the skills they need to succeed in the digital age. This training is a valuable opportunity for young people to learn new skills and gain practical experience," she said.

Itana Secures $2 Million Pre-Seed Funding to Pave the Way for Africa's First Digital Free Zone Itana (formerly Talent City) has raised $2 million in a pre-seed round led by global venture capitalists LocalGlobe, Amplo, Pronomos Capital, and Future Africa. The deal brings together a powerhouse of deep industry expertise and technical know-how from partners that have backed model digital societies such as e-Estonia, and built products that scale. Primed to be Africa’s first Digital Free Zone, this funding milestone will support Itana’s efforts to improve the ease-of-doing-business index, drive foreign direct investment, and catalyze employment in Nigeria. Itana is founded by Nigerian entrepreneurs, Luqman Edu (CEO) and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji (Founding Investor), alongside Coco Liu (COO). Luqman has an extensive portfolio, providing services and building technology solutions for cities and governments in the UK and Nigeria, while Iyinoluwa is the Founding Partner of Future Africa and Co-founder of Andela and Flutterwave. Coco brings operational excellence from her experience working for some of the biggest global tech companies and building early-stage startups. Itana Free Zone will be designed specifically for local and global startups, technology and service businesses looking to scale their operations across Africa without facing the challenges of unstable policies, infrastructural deficits and other business challenges. Using ‘Itana Edge’, our online one-stop-shop platform for business and government services, companies will also take advantage of globally competitive business policies and incentives (as a digital free-zone enterprise). These incentives include taxation, business visas, banking, capital repatriation and supportive legislation for businesses, whilst providing access to the local and international business community.
With this, Itana aims to provide an environment that will allow companies to operate a global business in Nigeria from anywhere in the world, and have access to the largest markets in Africa. “We are thrilled to announce this round of funding. It validates our efforts, and reiterates the aligned vision with our investors and partners to make it easy to invest and operate in Africa’s digital economy,” says Luqman Edu, Chief Executive Officer of Itana. “The African market is still largely untapped and Itana will provide the ideal business environment that will be fully online, for global and pan-African digital and service companies to use Nigeria as an anchorage to operate with ease across the continent.” Itana seeks to provide an online jurisdiction (virtual city) - similar to Delaware (U.S.), E-Estonia (Europe) or Dubai (Asia) - that allows global companies to remotely incorporate and operate in a Nigerian Free Zone without physical presence in one. Tech and service companies looking to launch virtually in Nigeria can sign up at www.itana.africa to join the waitlist to obtain an Itana Digital Free Zone business license, which will allow businesses to enjoy remote business set-up and operations. “Itana will enable entrepreneurs to build a globally respected business in Nigeria’s first digital free zone by leveraging benefits currently only enjoyed by traditional manufacturing or oil and gas industries who have traditionally set up in Nigeria’s free zones," says Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Founding Investor at Itana. “Within the Itana digital free zone startups will have the benefit of a stable policy environment, tax and capital repatriation incentives and the freedom to operate remotely without the need for an expansive physical presence within the free zone. I’m looking forward to the global businesses from Nigeria that will emerge from this.” The Itana community will also have access to their forthcoming flagship 72,000 sqm “live-work-build” campus, 'Itana District, sustainably designed within Alaro City (in Lekki Free Zone, just outside of Lagos, Nigeria), where they will host both permanent residents and visitors from the digital community for networking events, coworking, coliving, and more.
With the first phase of its development set for completion by 2027, the Itana District will lay the foundation of a model city and infrastructure for tech to build from Africa. "The market opportunity to serve digital service and technology businesses in Africa is significant - the ecosystem is growing at pace despite the huge infrastructure challenges faced by startups across the continent, says Yvonne Bajela, Partner at LocalGlobe. “We’ve seen the success of digital societies, such as e-Estonia, in enabling businesses to scale. We’re excited about the potential for Itana to proactively address these challenges whilst supporting a new generation of entrepreneurs in Nigeria and beyond. We’re thrilled to be backing such an ambitious team and look forward to working with them as they build a haven for African tech." In 2022, Itana launched a digital residency program that allows participants - especially business executives and future residents - to try out the e-governance system, global connectivity, and the promise of a strengthened digital economy in Africa. This online community of Itana Digital Residents has grown into a member network of about 3,000 tech innovators and entrepreneurs building for the African continent. “Having interacted with a number of international companies operating in Nigeria, I am optimistic about the impact Itana will bring to Africa's economy. We are building the infrastructure and systems to support businesses, so that things like opening a bank account or obtaining business licenses do not need physical presence” says Coco, Chief Operating Officer of Itana. “I hope that through what we build, we are able to provide a transparent and user-friendly platform to do business."
With a young and fast-growing population, Africa is an opportunity-rich continent for software developers and foreign direct investments - proven by Stripe Atlas (Delaware, U.S.) data showing a 400% year-on-year growth of incorporated businesses from Nigeria. Itana aims to create a culture that nurtures the ‘builders of tomorrow’ - a community of founders, entrepreneurs, creatives, innovators. Join the Itana waitlist and register your business in a digital free zone, visit www.itana.africa to get started.

Top 3 Tokens to Buy in September 2023: Shiba Inu, BNB, VC Spectra On August 29, crypto asset manager Grayscale won over the SEC. The victory overturned the SEC's decision to reject Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF application. Meanwhile, VC Spectra (SPCT) promises great returns at the end of its public presale. Let's see why this is possible and how it makes SPCT the top crypto to buy in 2023. How has the ruling affected the dominant sentiment towards Shiba Inu (SHIB) and BNB (BNB)? Let’s find out. >>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<< Shiba Inu (SHIB): Shibarium Bridge Now Online On August 28, 2023, Shiba Inu (SHIB) developers announced that token withdrawals out of the Shibarium bridge are now live and available to users.
This is coming shortly after a much-anticipated launch that failed miserably due to several software issues that caused millions of dollars in Shiba Inu network funds to be frozen. Withdrawals of Shibarium ecosystem tokens Shiba Inu (SHIB), Leash (LEASH), and Wrapped Ether (wETH) will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours to be processed, while Bone (BONE) withdrawals could take up to 7 days. The news has had a positive effect on Shiba Inu (SHIB) price and will also positively affect SHIB price prediction for the coming days. Since the news broke, Shiba Inu's (SHIB) price has increased by 1.8% from $0.00000823 to $0.00000838. The SHIB price prediction for 2023 is $0.00001083. The endorsements of cryptocurrencies by governments like the Hong Kong government and the pause on interest rate hikes by the US Fed are expected to contribute to this upward trend. This indicates that Shiba Inu (SHIB) might currently be the top crypto to invest in. With the potential of Shibarium to grow into a prominent Layer 2 project, Shiba Inu's price prediction for 2030 ranges between $0.00004785 and $0.00006056. Binance Labs Is The Top Web3 Investor In Six Months: Will It Drive BNB (BNB) Price Up? According to Messari on August 27, Binance Labs was the lead investor in more than 80% of the deals executed in the last six months.
Binance Labs took the lead investor role in 14 out of 17 deals, nearly double that of the second-best DWF Labs. Messari said this was part of a new policy to assist established projects in expanding to the Binance Coin (BNB) Chain. After the news broke, the BNB coin price increased by 7.1% from $216.37 on August 27 to $228.57 as of August 29. However, most of the increase was a result of Grayscale's victory. According to analysts' BNB price prediction for next week, BNB coin price could reach $319.99 by September 11, buoyed by the market's bullish reaction to the Grayscale ruling. VC Spectra (SPCT) Guarantees Profits For Investors VC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized asset management protocol and trading platform that aims to democratize access to the blockchain and technology industry and provide investors with sustainable and profitable returns. Investors earn profits on the VC Spectra (SPCT) platform in two ways. One is through investing in promising blockchain ventures, while the second way is to profit from VC Spectra (SPCT) price increases. VC Spectra (SPCT) is committed to providing access to promising projects, ethical & responsible investment practices, and transparency & accountability.
VC Spectra (SPCT) raised $2.4 million in the private seed sale round. This is a reflection of the early belief in the protocol's potential. Stage 1 investors in the presale have already gained 212.5% ROI. Similarly, Stage 2 investors have gained 127.27%. The presale is currently at Stage 3, with SPCT tokens selling at $0.025. Stage 3 participants will gain 32% at Stage 4 and 220% at the end of the presale. This imminent profit for investors is why VC Spectra (SPCT) is the best crypto to invest in now.

The Nigeria Art, Culture and Creative Economy Minister Hannatu Musawa outlined an 8-point plan in a video message to the creative Industries & other stakeholders Nigeria’s Minister of Art, Culture and Creative Economy, Hannatu Musa Musawa, outlined a plan for Nigeria's creative economy at the Art & Tech district in Abuja, Nigeria. Full transcript of speech below Hello & a good day to you (BarkanMu, Mokiyin, Ndewo, Salut, Buenos Dias, Marhaba, Ni hao), I am Hannatu Musawa, the Federal Minister of the newly created Ministry of Art, Culture, and the Creative Economy. I have a clear vision to make Nigeria the creative, cultural and entertainment capital of the World. It is a mandate from the presidency and the people to grow this sector, creating new jobs, new revenue, a firmer policy framework, and supporting new creations & artistic expressions of our greatest resource, The Nigerian People. A strong creative and cultural economy is a key driver of growth & presents an opportunity to accelerate Nigeria's development on a local and a global stage. The creative economy is an economy of ideas, an economy of innovation, and an economy of invention in the digital age. The scope of this sector is extensive and encompasses the production and distribution of ideas, goods and services that are the result of human creativity, skill, and talent across all aspects of Nigerian culture. I strongly believe that our culture is a valuable currency.
Creativity is the new oil, and innovation is our future. To this end, we have created a comprehensive eight-point plan that will deliver our collective vision for this sector. (1) Firstly, Nigeria Destination 2030 is a national initiative designed to grow the arts, culture and creative economy under one united vision. Nigeria Destination 2030 is a manifesto, a mission and a vision to become Africa's creative capital. Most importantly, it’s a promise to deliver more jobs, more inbound visitors, and more local opportunities that will enhance the development of all creative sectors. Therefore, (2) Skills development will be prioritised through comprehensive training programs to ensure all professionals within the economy are well-prepared to excel in their respective fields. Accelerated growth of the creative economy means we need to prioritise and (3) Fastrack the improvement, creation and implementation of policy frameworks that effectively stimulate increased revenue generation, job creation, and sustainable growth across the entire sector. A key part of that strategy is Intellectual Property Protection to safeguard the creations of artists and content creators, fostering innovation and creativity. (4) Our Collective Success Requires Focused Strategy, Governance, and Collaboration.
Our team is developing a comprehensive and effective strategy for the arts, culture, and creative economy. Within this strategy, we will clearly outline our objectives, targets, and actions for sectoral growth and development. Its implementation will be underpinned by a cohesive governance structure that will foster collaboration among government agencies, private sector entities, academia, and artists to drive the growth of the FMACC ecosystem. We will further support this collaborative structure by establishing a Creative Economy Advisory Council that will provide high-level strategic support to the Ministry. I look forward to working closely with Ministry, departments, agencies and all other stakeholders to deliver our vision. (5) We need to achieve our goals faster, and that requires smart strategic partnerships. As such, our fifth point sets out to facilitate the creation of Public-Private partnerships that will stimulate investment in the creative economy and expedite the development of critical infrastructure, technology, and innovation hubs. In addition, it aims to leverage PPPs to catalyse private sector investment in FMACC, enhancing economic diversification and creating a favourable business environment. (6) Our plan has clear growth targets. Among those targets is our ambition to elevate the Nigerian industries, comprising Art, Culture & Creative industries to rank among the top 20 globally in terms of GDP contribution, wealth creation, employment, and poverty reduction in line with the agenda 2050.
Through innovative strategies, technological integration, and enhanced market access, our target is to increase the value of sectoral outputs by 50%. in line with the 2021 to 2025 national development plan. (7) To Create Enabling Business Environments, we will prioritise infrastructural development aided by Digital transformation . We will provide modern facilities, transportation networks, and technology infrastructure. We will prioritise the integration of arts, culture, and creative content onto digital platforms, harnessing technology to create new revenue streams Every effort will be made to facilitate the growth of a thriving business and support startups and entrepreneurs by establishing innovative hubs and incubators. By creating and supporting cultural centres of excellence, we will preserve and promote culture, foster creativity and innovation, and further support those with the potential to contribute to the sector's growth. (8) Cultural Heritage Preservation and sustainability are crucial to our agenda. We must make every effort to safeguard Nigeria's rich cultural heritage while fostering tourism and economic growth. This involves implementing initiatives to preserve and celebrate our cultural heritage while ensuring its longevity for future generations.
Within these initiatives, we will establish International Quality Assurance standards and monitoring mechanisms to improve the quality of outputs within the Nigerian arts, culture, and creative economy, thereby enhancing the value proposition of all our creative products and services.

Although Agboola indicated that a Flutterwave IPO is inevitable, he also admitted that “the markets aren’t great right now." Will Flutterwave really go ahead with IPO plans? This is not the first time Flutterwave has teased going public. It first revealed IPO intentions officially in August 2022. According to a report, the IPO will be rolled out on the Nasdaq stock exchange and will be used to expand the fintech's operation in existing markets and expand into new African markets. However, it didn't go ahead with the IPO.
While Flutterwave is reiterating its IPO plans, it has not shared figures that indicate its growth and readiness for a public offering. It declined to share an annual increase in total revenue with Bloomberg but said the payment processing side of the business increased 23-fold in the first half of 2023. Although Flutterwave has been vague in its plans to go public, there are indicators that an IPO could be imminent. For example, the participation of a cross-over investor —cross-over investors often invest in growing businesses right before they IPO — like Whale Rock Capital in its last funding round. While Flutterwave hasn't given a specific date for its IPO, only time will tell if it'll eventually go through with it. Can a Flutterwave IPO make Agboola a US dollar billionaire? According to PitchBook, The value of Agboola's stake in Flutterwave was estimated to be over $370 million as of the fintech's last funding round in 2022. Some people believe Agboola's stake in Flutterwave could make him a billionaire if Flutterwave goes public. Boss where do you get your data from ?So if their IPO is very successful ...gb might be a billionaire soon...— Blank Name🇮🇱 (@ojiomaaa) August 22, 2023 While it is difficult to predict what will happen if Flutterwave goes public, it is unlikely that Agboola's $370 million will make him a billionaire.
The value of his stake in the company after an IPO will be determined by the value of Flutterwave after the IPO. How do we determine Flutterwave's value in the event of an IPO? The value of a company after an IPO depends on many many factors such as sentiment, demand and supply of shares, and market conditions. However, one way to make an educated guess is to use the market capitalisation formula, which is the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the price of shares after an IPO. This formula will help us arrive at a post-IPO valuation by assuming that the number of outstanding shares in Flutterwave remains the same before and after the IPO. Since Flutterwave hasn't gone public, the number of outstanding shares isn't readily available, but by dividing its current valuation by its share price, we can get an idea of what the number of outstanding shares is. According to Notice.co, a website that sources private market data from regulatory filings, media, and an international collective of brokers, investors and employees, Flutterwave's current share price is $29. Given that Flutterwave's current valuation is $3 billion, this means Flutterwave's outstanding shares are 103 million. It is important to note that the share price of a private company isn't always accurate if it is not coming directly from the company. Now that we have the number of outstanding shares, we need to make yet another assumption that Flutterwave's IPO will be successful and its share price will go up by 31% just like another African startup, Jumia, after its IPO.
This means Flutterwave's share price will go from $29 pre-IPO to $38. Flutterwave's post-IPO valuation, is therefore $3.9 billion. Agboola's stake after post-IPO valuation of $3.9 billion Agboola's $370 million stake represents 12.33% of Flutterwave. His stake percentage multiplied by Flutterwave's $3.9 billion valuation means that his post-IPO stake will become $480.8 million. While these calculations are riddled with several assumptions, it is a relatively good-case scenario. Agboola would need to own a higher percentage of Flutterwave to join the ranks of Africa's tech billionaires. Disclaimer: These calculations are based on figures from PitchBook and Notice.co, which Techpoint Africa cannot independently verify.
4 alternatives to the Tech Nation visa for African tech talents A random Internet search about people's reactions to the news of Tech Nation's imminent shutdown points to the fact that the organisation has pioneered several initiatives that have impacted lives across several continents, especially its visa programs. The news was received with sadness. The UK's Global Talent Visa program enables migrants to work in any sector within specific endorsement categories in the UK. To clarify, tech talent can only access this program through Tech Nation's recommendation, which is one of its six recognized endorsement organisations. This highlights the potential bottleneck if new backers are not gotten after March 31, 2023, when applications will no longer be accepted. The visa is valid for one to five years and can be renewed/extended indefinitely (leading to permanent residency) if certain requirements are met, including the endorsing organization not withdrawing and proof of earning income during the stay. Fun Fact: Over the last decade, Tech Nation has endorsed more than 3,000 individuals from 94 countries worldwide. Nigeria is one of the countries with the highest representation in its alumni, along with India and Russia. Different countries have various ways of attracting manpower into them.
Many of these countries often face a shortage of willing workers and thus welcome immigrants to fill these roles. Others simply do it for economic or diversity reasons. Although there are similar visas to the Global Talent Visa available globally, especially in migration hotspots, the following countries have provisions for digital technology talent, innovators, and investors. Global Talent Stream (Canada) The Global Talent Stream program in Canada was created to attract highly-skilled foreign workers to the country and help Canadian companies acquire the skills they need. The Stream is part of Canada's larger Express Entry immigration system. If successful, it can lead to permanent residency after meeting certain criteria. The program specifically focuses on tech jobs and provides Canadian tech companies access to top talent from around the world, including innovators, founders, cybersecurity experts, web developers, web designers, data scientists, software engineers, etc. Like the UK's Global Talent Visa, the Global Talent Stream has a list of designated partners, such as TECHNATION and the Council of Canadian Innovators, that refer candidates (companies in this case). However, unlike the Global Talent Visa, individuals cannot directly apply for this program.
They must first be offered a job by a Canadian employer who can demonstrate a need for their skills, and they must have relevant qualifications or experience. The application will also be done by the employer under either of two categories. Find out more here. US Founder Visa This is a non-immigrant visa for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability or achievements in their field. It is also known as the 0-1 Visa and is a three-year temporary work visa, which can be renewed in one-year increments. Although information about the visa indicates that it is for exceptional individuals in the fields of science, arts, education, business, or athletics, tech talents and entrepreneurs can also take advantage of it. Usually, eligibility is determined by meeting at least three of eight requirements, including membership in prestigious groups, awards, and national/international recognition, among others. Founders who have successfully graduated from a prestigious accelerator or have venture-backed startups are also more likely to have higher possibilities. This visa is also open to talent occupying core and adjacent tech roles, from software engineers to product designers.

Global Talent Program (Australia) The Global Talent Program in Australia is launched to attract highly-skilled foreign workers to the country to help Australian companies get the skills they need. This program has a focus on critical skill sectors, including fintech, healthtech, and agritech, and requires candidates to have relevant tech skills and the ability to earn above the Fair Work high-income threshold of AUD162,000. The program allows individuals to self-sponsor or be sponsored by an Australian employer. To be considered eligible, they must be assessed and recommended by one of the approved endorsing bodies in Australia. After spending at least three to four years in the country with this visa, individuals can apply for permanent residency and citizenship. More information can be found here. Global Impact Visa (New Zealand) The government of New Zealand created the Global Impact Visa (GIV) to bring in high-impact entrepreneurs and innovators to grow its tech sector.
The 3-year work visa is designed for individuals who intend to come to New Zealand to establish and run a tech business or enterprise. To be eligible, applicants must have a high level of expertise and a strong track record of innovation. Meanwhile, the success and track record of the venture they start will determine if they can renew or apply for permanent residency. The GIV is also open to investors who are willing to support it. The GIV was launched in 2019, but the last cohort accepted was in 2020. The only endorsing body for the GIV is the Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF), and there is currently no timeline for accepting new entries. Find more information here.
BLUETTI Product Guide: Your Ultimate Power Solution to Have Free and Sufficient Electricity 86 percent of Nigeria's vast population of over 200 million people currently lack access to electricity. Even 5.96 million of those who do have electricity are overcharged by the country's electricity distribution companies, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Amidst this energy challenge, BLUETTI, a leading clean energy storage company, offers effective solutions to help address Nigeria's power deficit. With BLUETTI's solar power stations, Nigerians can harness free solar energy and have reliable backups during power outages. Let's dive into these products and discover how they can truly make a difference. AC200MAX+B230 - Scalable Home Backup Power BLUETTI’s flagship model, the AC200MAX, features a substantial 2,048Wh battery capacity and a powerful 2,200W AC output (4,800W surge). The 16-outlet power station provides uninterrupted power to most household appliances and essential devices during power outages, including refrigerators, air conditioners, and electric ovens. A notable feature of the AC200MAX is its expandability.
It lets you increase the total capacity to 6,144Wh by adding two 2,048Wh B230 battery units. An AC200MAX unit can power a 150W refrigerator for 10 hours, a 10W light bulb for over 150 hours, and a 5000 BTU AC for approximately 1-4 hours. By adding B230 battery units, you can extend the power supply to these appliances twice or even thrice the duration. The AC200MAX offers 7 charging methods, either separately or in combination, for flexible and fast recharging. For example, it takes approximately 5 to 6 hours to fully charge the AC200MAX using an AC adapter at 500W, but by combining 900W of solar power with AC charging for a maximum of 1,400W dual input, the charging time could be reduced to less than 3 hours. EP500Pro - Powerhouse for Extended Power Outages The EP500Pro comes with a massive 5,100Wh capacity and an impressive 3,000W output. It can provide electricity to the entire house, ensuring that the lights stay on, food remains fresh in the refrigerators, and all essential equipment is running. Featuring sensitive UPS functionality, it switches over seamlessly within 20ms in the event of a power outage, providing uninterrupted power at all times. The EP500Pro can handle multiple devices simultaneously with its 15 power outlets.
It can charge various devices simultaneously. For instance, it can run a 100W smart TV for about 50 hours, a 500W space heater for 8.6 hours, and a 1,000W microwave for 4.3 hours. Despite its weight, the EP500Pro has four sturdy wheels at the bottom, making it easy to move and position wherever you need power. The EP500Pro is powered by safe and reliable LifePO4 lithium iron phosphate batteries that can deliver at least 3,500 life cycles before reaching 80% of their original capacity. This is approximately equivalent to ten years of use at one discharge per day. Plus, the EP500Pro is equipped with an intelligent Battery Management System (BMS) that ensures efficient battery usage and protects against overcharging and over-discharging for peace of mind. EB3A/EB70 - Compact Emergency Power If you are looking for portable power solutions for emergencies, the EB3A and EB70 offer compact and powerful options. Weighing only 4.6kg, the EB3A offers 268Wh of capacity with 600W of power output to power electronics and small devices. The EB3A features 9 versatile outlets and can charge a 100W laptop for approximately 3.5 hours, a 60W mini fridge for 3.6 hours, and a 5W light for 30 hours.
Small as it is, the EB3A could be an uninterruptible power supply with a responsive UPS feature, powering critical loads during sudden power failures. The EB3A can be recharged in any way, either by AC, solar panels, car, or generator. It even supports a 430W dual charge, fully recharging within two hours. Even more impressive is the EB3A's capability for remote monitoring and control via a dedicated BLUETTI app on your phone. The EB70 has a larger capacity of 716Wh while weighing only 9.7kg. With 12 outlets and 1,000W of power, it could charge various essentials and mid-range devices during power cuts. A 12W lamp could keep on for 50 hours, a 400W juicer for 1.5 hours, and a WIFI router for 65 hours, not to mention small devices such as phones, computers, and speakers for more runtime. The EB70 also accepts multiple charging methods, including wall outlets, solar panels, and cars. Pairing to an adapter or solar panels for 200W input, it charges quickly in under 5 hours to minimize downtime. BLUETTI equips almost all of its power stations with an intuitive screen for better monitoring and management of the battery storage, and the EB70 is no exception.
Empower All in Need Driven by its mission to empower communities and individuals, BLUETTI is committed to bringing clean energy to every home for a sustainable future. Since 2021, BLUETTI has launched the 5-year LAAF (Lighting an African Family) program to bring electricity to off-grid households in Africa. BLUETTI's latest endeavor is a partnership with Solar Sister, donating home solar kits to Nigerian women in off-grid families. Along the way, BLUETTI will continue to bring light and hope to those without. In response to Nigeria's insufficient power supply, BLUETTI shines as a beacon of hope, providing efficient and dependable power solutions to both households and businesses. Dedicated to making clean energy accessible to all, BLUETTI has recently organized offline activities in four communities of Lagos. These events offer residents a unique opportunity to experience various BLUETTI power products firsthand and conveniently charge their devices on-site for free during power outages.

Founded in 1996 as a B2B wholesale business, Paxo pharmaceutical limited - a subsidiary under the Paxo Group - established itself as a trusted supplier to pharmacies, supermarkets, and local stores nationwide. However, as online marketplaces like Jumia, Dealdey, Konga, Kaymu, and GTB marketplace emerged, relying solely on these platforms proved limiting.

Partnering with design agency Cregital, Paxo Beauty revamped its branding and website to resonate with its audience. Leveraging Instagram and Facebook for commerce in 2016, Paxo Beauty experienced rapid growth, achieving monthly sales of approximately 150,000 Naira. In 2020, Paxo Beauty further enhanced its customer experience by launching an easy-to-use mobile app for iOS and Android. The revamped platform offers a seamless shopping experience, a user-friendly interface, improved navigation, and diverse product options.
A loyalty program was also introduced, allowing customers to earn money with each purchase, contributing to an impressive monthly revenue of 10 million naira. The app's relaunch underscores Paxo Beauty's commitment to technology and innovation. The brand's team of developers, UX designers, product managers, and content experts created a digital ecosystem to elevate the customer journey. "Paxo Beauty is dedicated to delivering exceptional products and experiences," said Jumoke Olukoya, CEO of Paxo Beauty.

How African edtech startup, Educare bootstrapped its way to three continents It was Nelson Mandela who said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." While you'll hear the occasional debate about the suitability of Nigeria's current educational system, many will agree that good education can significantly alter the trajectory of an individual's life. But for students to get the most benefit out of any teaching endeavour, educators must be properly equipped to discharge their duties. A little thought experiment should help us understand the challenges that school owners and administrators face. We'll assume that Lagbaja is the proprietor of a private school in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria. This school has 1,000 students and 700 parents/guardians. If he hopes to remain in business, he must properly manage the expectations of these two groups. But he also has employees to think about because his school's success is tied to theirs. As the proprietor, some of the tasks he has to deal with include receiving payment for school fees and other levies; he also needs to monitor attendance and students' performances.
That way, he can generate reports to keep parents abreast of their ward's progress and identify areas for improvement. He also has to monitor the performance of the teachers he employs. These are just a few of his responsibilities, but you get the picture. A lot of work goes into managing or running a school, and school administrators need as much help as they can get. That's where Educare comes in, but first, a look at how the startup got its start. Leaving agricultural engineering to build software solutions Alex Onyia is the CEO of Educare. He's also an alumni of the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he studied agricultural and bio-resources engineering. But he's never worked in agricultural engineering. While growing up, Onyia's mother worked as a manager in the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL).
Due to her position, the family could afford to get a computer, hence his early exposure and interest in computers. After discovering that some of the popular programs he enjoyed were built by writing code, he began learning how to create software. By the time he got into the University of Nigeria in 2007, he was already building and designing websites for businesses. In between classes and extracurricular activities, he honed his skill building software solutions for businesses globally. While he loved building software, he also knew that he needed to make money from the products he built, so after graduation, he decided to learn how to monetise software products. To do this, he started a software development company that took on short-term projects from businesses and government agencies such as the Nigerian Ministry of Power. Software is not driven by contracts "I've always known that software is not driven by contracts. If you really want to be successful in [building] software products, you need to find one part and do it well, so that's why we decided to focus on education." Quizzed about Educare's beginnings, he replied with a candour that is uncommon among tech entrepreneurs.
"In Nigeria, there's almost nothing like a new idea, but the common problem with Nigerian ideas is the reliability of available solutions. There are so many bank apps, but you know how frequently they disappoint you when you want to make a transfer. In the education space, there are a lot of people trying to build software solutions, but they're always crappy." What is now Educare traces its origins to a 2014 contract from the Lekki British School to build a school management software. After delivering the project and seeing its impact, the team decided to build a business around it, leading to Educare's current iteration. "At Educare, we are solving the complex challenges faced by educational institutions in managing their finance, human resources, academic records, and overall school operations. The problems we address are the inefficiencies, manual processes, and lack of integration that often plague these areas in schools." Educare's software digitises student records, assessments, and transcripts. Using the data it collects, teachers can provide personalised learning for students. Its HR software also integrates with payroll management systems
More than 1,400 private schools in Nigeria, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the United States use Educare's software to ease their processes. While schools pay a fee for each student the software serves, it also offers custom plans. Growth challenges Despite Onyia's impressive entrepreneurial experience, building an edtech startup from Nigeria has not been easy. He explains that the bootstrapped startup has faced a few challenges, especially with onboarding schools. "The level of difficulty in getting school owners to accept Educare's product may vary depending on several factors, such as the school's existing systems, budget constraints, resistance to change, and the perception of the value the software brings. "Some school owners may be hesitant to adopt new technology due to concerns about implementation, training, and potential disruption to their current processes. They may also have reservations about the initial investment required for the software and its long-term benefits." Educare's ability to provide satisfactory answers to their questions has seen the startup take on more clients.

Perpetual futures in the crypto market involve speculating on the price of a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but without a fixed settlement date. Trading perpetual futures or perpetual contracts has become popular due to its flexibility, as traders can profit from both rising and falling markets.

roHealth Transforms into Motherboard, Promises New Era for Employee Benefits Management roHealth, the employee health benefits platform, has announced today that it is rebranding to become Motherboard, a comprehensive employee benefits platform for Africa. After 2 years of operations, roHealth is expanding its horizons to include more employee benefits beyond health insurance. With this expansion comes a new name, new look, and a new product to better represent the company’s new direction. The decision to expand stems from roHealth's commitment to cater to the evolving needs of Africa's dynamic workforce. With a drastic rise in cost of living across Africa, Motherboard comes as a timely solution, addressing a crucial need in today’s market. Lekan Olude, Motherboard’s CEO and ex-co-founder of Jobberman, expressed his excitement for the company's future: “We have seen first-hand the effects roHealth has had on employee health benefits for our users. Employers who use roHealth have shared stories of how it reduces costs for them while providing a better experience for employees. And now, they are asking questions about how they can replicate this effect outside healthcare.
These are the questions that we built Motherboard as the answer to. We had the expertise of solving this problem for health benefits – we just had to transfer that expertise to a wider range of benefits.” Motherboard is set to be the #1 employee benefits platform for any company with African employees. With benefits across health insurance, food & groceries, transportation, and many more, Motherboard wants to enhance benefits access for employees and reduce employee retention costs for employers. Motherboard boasts over 100 merchants on its platform (including players like Shoprite, Ebeano, FIlmhouse Cinemas, and 15+ HMOs), allowing employees to tailor their benefits to suit their unique needs within their employer's assigned budget. About Motherboard Motherboard, formerly known as roHealth, is a comprehensive employee benefit management platform that empowers employers and employees across Africa. With a focus on enhancing benefits access and disbursement at lower costs, Motherboard is committed to revolutionizing the way employee benefits are managed and experienced. You can read more about the rebrand or check out Motherboard’s website for more information. Motherboard is also hosting an Ask Me Anything Session by 5pm on Thursday, August 10, 2023 where they will give a live demo and answer pressing questions about the rebrand.
