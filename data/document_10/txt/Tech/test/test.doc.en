11 signs that you work at a startup So, you’ve joined a startup. You’ve said goodbye to the trusty old multinational and are riding high on the startup wave. Here’s when you know it. You think corporates are evil One of the reasons you chose a startup over a well established firm is your discomfort with the corporate culture, the red tape and of course the idea of being a small fish at a big pond. There’s no looking back. You now hate the same corporates with a vengeance and could swear you didn’t know how you ever worked at one. But at the same time, you envy their fat pay cheques and perks Even then, once in a while you’re gripped by jealously at your MNC friends’ regular and sizeable salaries despite clearly working harder than them.
You wish you had health insurance, free transport and a subsidised office canteen too. You regularly work from home, yours or someone else’s. No glass and concrete tech park this. You most likely work out of the founders’ apartment or a shared working space and the family from the house sometimes drops by and mingles effortlessly with the staff. Either ways, you work in a small, closed environment where everyone knows everyone and there are no cubicles and so you literally think out of your box. Office lunches are usually like family dinners There’s no office mess or Sodexo coupons. Lunch is brought, and shared by all, possibly around a small dining table. It’s like being back at the school all over again. Your boss is your idol by day, and your drinking buddy at night
Startups are like a joint family business where your boss and your colleagues are more like your friends, sharing your aspirations and your drive. They probably know all about your life, your girlfriend, and your pet hamster, and it’s perfectly normal that sometimes your boss communicates with you on Twitter. Birthdays are perfect occasions for an office party. You can turn up in office wearing just about anything You’ve been doing everything from drawing up the media strategy to fixing the coffee machine You often have work that you don’t want or did not do at your last company. You regularly work from home, yours or someone else’s. There’s a how-to video for that! The cafe is your office When bored of your humble office, you actively seek out coffee shops with WiFi as potential working spaces.
You could really work from anywhere. Your boss doesn’t have an issue, as long as your get the job done. You probably got the startup job through its founder Or an ex-colleague or a friend over a drinks conversation at a pub spinning off from a “I need to do something better with my life” kind of existential question. It was the best day ever when your company made its first $1000 It wasn’t easy, it wasn’t quick. The founder/s put their heart and soul into starting something they believed in, and you worked through every step of that. You felt like a common dream come true the day your startup had its first share of success. It was personal. No matter how small the company is, you always have this sense of pride that you’re onto something big
So you’ve let go of your corporate perks, the money, the comfort and are working harder than you ever have. Because you have this conviction that you have a real chance to make a dent in the universe. One problem solved at a time.

Remote worker or not, you have no excuse not to exercise. And here's why Key Takeaways Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory disease, and diabetes, are the leading cause of death globally and are emerging global health threats. However, regular exercise can improve cardiovascular health, muscular strength, and flexibility while reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. From fitness apps and wearables to online fitness resources and communities, technology is making workouts more accessible, engaging, and effective than ever. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory disease, and diabetes, are the leading cause of death globally and are emerging global health threats. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicted that Africa would see the highest increase in death rates from non-communicable diseases over the following ten years. According to a 2022 WHO fact sheet, 17 million people die from an NCD before they turn 70 annually. These premature deaths account for 86% of the deaths in low- and middle-income nations and 77% of all NCD-related deaths occur there.
Sadly, by 2030, non-communicable diseases will reportedly be the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, surpassing communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases. Mobile apps, EHRs, and other tech tools assisting Africans in managing and preventing diseases Why is there a rise in NCDs in Africa? Several factors, including an ageing population, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and restricted access to early detection, prevention, and treatment, have contributed to the rise in NCDs on the continent. Besides, poverty and inequality in Africa frequently result in a lack of access to healthy food choices, risk-free exercise environments, and quality healthcare services, making NCD prevention and management more challenging. Rapid urbanisation in Africa has caused lifestyle and dietary shifts, with more people consuming highly processed foods high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Technology advancements have also led to a rise in sedentary lifestyles and a consequent decline in physical activity levels. However, regular exercise can improve cardiovascular health, muscular strength, and flexibility while reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. But before we dig further, we must understand the difference between physical activity and exercise. What’s the distinction between physical activity and exercise?
According to the WHO, physical activity includes all skeletal muscle-driven movements that require spending energy, including those performed while working, playing, performing household chores, travelling, and participating in recreational activities. This explains why a sedentary lifestyle decreases physical activity, raising your risk of developing an NCD. On a weekday, for instance, I typically spend eight hours at my computer screen and only rise from my bed or desk to eat or take toilet breaks. The inevitable health risks of disruptive tech innovation Because I spend at least six hours daily sitting or lying down without engaging in much physical activity, I lead a sedentary lifestyle. How long do you typically spend working in your office if you don't work from home? Sitting in a car or bus doesn’t count as physical activity. Unless you walk or ride a bicycle to your workplace, you need to do more physical activity. Weekly, WHO recommends that adults between 18 and 64 years engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both. Adults should engage in 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, or the equivalent, for additional health benefits.
They can also dedicate two or more days a week to performing exercises that target muscle groups. Consequently, whether you work from home or have a 9–5 schedule, it would help if you incorporated physical activities into your workday. "Physical activity" and "exercise" should not be used interchangeably because exercise or a workout typically refers to a structured, planned, and repetitive form of physical activity with a predetermined objective, such as increasing muscular strength, enhancing cardiovascular fitness, or losing weight. Why is exercise important? Studies have shown that regular exercise lengthens life. A Harvard University study revealed that people who engaged in the minimum recommended amount of physical activity reduced their risk of early death by as much as 21%. Per a different study, regular exercise can extend a person's life by three to five years. Regular workouts can strengthen the cardiovascular system, increase bone and muscle mass, increase flexibility, and lower the risk of developing chronic diseases. Running or cycling, for instance, can help strengthen the heart and lungs, lowering the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions. Exercises that increase bone and muscle mass, such as weightlifting or resistance band work, can reduce the risk of osteoporosis.
Have you ever worked out and felt so relaxed and stress-free? I have, and workouts have proven to improve mental health by reducing stress, depression, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. They also help to elevate your mood and enhance cognitive function. For instance, incorporating yoga or mindfulness meditation into a workout routine can help lower stress and anxiety. Regular exercise can lower your risk of obesity by helping you burn calories and increase your muscle mass. Aerobic exercises like jogging or swimming can help you burn calories while helping to build muscle mass, which burns more calories even when you're at rest. Because they get better and longer sleep, people who exercise regularly feel more rested and energised. For instance, light exercises, such as yoga or strolling, can improve your sleep, whereas vigorous ones, including weightlifting or sprinting, can lengthen it. Despite these benefits, many people fail to exercise because their schedules are too busy with obligations to their families, jobs, and other activities. While some people may not have the means to exercise, others don’t have access to sports facilities, gyms, or other resources that can support the activity.
Also, some may struggle to stay motivated, especially if they don't enjoy it or see immediate results. Others may not know how to exercise well or comprehend the advantages of exercise. Chronic pain and mobility issues are two of these conditions that can make exercising difficult or uncomfortable. Besides, others may experience anxiety or self-consciousness when exercising in front of others or in public, which can keep them from beginning or maintaining a routine. Interestingly, technology is helping by addressing the obstacles to exercise and promoting healthy living. And now, there is no reason not to exercise In recent years, technology has fundamentally changed many facets of our lives, including how we approach physical activity and fitness. Additionally, there has been a rise in interest in exercise regimens and fitness in Africa as more people become aware of the advantages of regular exercise for their physical and mental health. At the same time, technology has advanced quickly, significantly impacting Africa's fitness space. It has been playing a pivotal role in revolutionising the way people exercise and stay fit. But how?
Personalised workout plans Individuals can access personalised workout plans crafted to meet their unique needs and goals. Fitness apps and wearables can track several health metrics, such as heart rate, sleep patterns, and steps taken, and use that data to create personalised workout plans. Some smartphones, including Samsung, do this. You don't need to download any additional apps. Simply visit "Samsung Health" to begin monitoring your health metrics. Also, Apple Fitness+ is available in the Fitness app if you have an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. Fitness tracking devices such as fitness bands and smartwatches are becoming more widely available in Africa. Apple Watch is one such example. You can also download other apps, such as Google Fit if your smartphone does not already have them.
You can use this to stay motivated, track your fitness levels, and plan effective workouts. You can have workouts tailored to your needs via these plans based on several variables, including fitness level, age, and health. A personalised fitness approach can help you achieve better results and ensure safe and effective workouts. Online classes and information The COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily forced the closure of many gyms and fitness facilities, was a factor in expanding online fitness classes and resources on the continent. Africa now has access to virtual fitness classes taught by instructors around the globe due to online platforms and video conferencing apps. Because more people can now participate in fitness classes outside their immediate surroundings, more people have access to fitness information, eliminating the need for a fitness coach, which may be costly. Africans can access workout routines, exercise videos, and fitness advice via several fitness apps, websites, and social media platforms, allowing them to learn about nutrition, different exercise techniques, and general health and wellness. Because of smartphone penetration and Internet connectivity on the continent, this information empowers them to make informed decisions about their fitness goals and strategies. Consequently, you don't have to go to a gym to exercise.
YouTube has a wealth of information, including exercise videos for every type of exercise. You can do this before you leave for work or after you get back. You should be motivated by your health metrics. Additionally, you can look up resources by searching for keywords like "exercise," "aerobics," and "workout" on any social media platform. Online communities Technology has also contributed to the growth of online fitness communities in Africa. Fitness enthusiasts can now connect, share tips, and support one another in their fitness journeys on social media platforms, online communities, and forums dedicated to fitness. These online communities provide a sense of motivation, encouragement, and accountability, which can be crucial in maintaining a consistent workout routine. Online fitness communities also promote a sense of belonging and community by fostering a positive atmosphere where people can support one another, share successes, and work through obstacles. Home workout equipment
Technology has made it simpler for many to set up their home gyms through affordable and compact workout equipment. There are now many options available for people to exercise in the comfort of their homes, ranging from resistance bands to portable exercise machines. It helps those without gyms or fitness centres where they live. There is a growing selection of fitness equipment designed specifically for Africans' needs and budgets, ranging from reasonably priced home gym setups to locally made fitness gear. Depending on your exercise type, your home gym can include a yoga or exercise mat, resistance bands in different weight ranges, a stability ball, a step bench or a box, an ab wheel, gliding discs, or a jump rope. If you’re conscious and don’t know how to get started, you can watch online resources while using your workout equipment. How to plan a workout schedule Planning a workout schedule that you can stick to can be difficult, but with the right strategy, it is possible. Here are some tips. Assess your fitness level
Identifying your current fitness level is a crucial first step in creating a workout schedule to meet your needs and goals. You can determine your level of fitness in the following ways: Monitoring your heart rate while you exercise is one way to evaluate your cardiovascular endurance. Wearing a heart rate monitor or using a fitness tracker will allow you to determine your heart rate. You can also run for 12 minutes as part of a 12-minute run test to gauge your cardiovascular endurance. You can gauge your level of muscular strength by doing exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, or squats and counting how many repetitions you can perform. To test your muscular endurance, perform workouts, such as planks, wall sits, or lunges, and time how long you can hold the positions. To measure flexibility, sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you and extend your reach forward to perform a sit-and-reach test. Use tools like skinfold callipers to calculate your body fat percentage to determine your body composition. You can also gauge your general health and risk of chronic diseases using measurements like waist circumference or body mass index (BMI).
You can practice exercises like standing on one leg while closing your eyes or walking heel to toe in a straight line to test your balance and coordination. Set realistic goals Setting attainable goals comes after assessing your current fitness level. Your objectives should be challenging but doable in a reasonable amount of time. Create a balanced routine and start slowly It's crucial to choose exercises that work with your strategy, so plan your workouts and integrate them into your daily or weekly schedule. Choose a time that is convenient for you. It's crucial to begin slowly and build up to a higher level of intensity over time. It will make it easier to stay on your workout schedule and prevent injuries. Mix up your workouts and track your progress
It's crucial to vary your workouts to prevent boredom and plateauing. Try new exercises, increase the intensity, or incorporate new activities. You can monitor your progress by keeping a record of your workouts and monitoring your fitness level. Doing so should keep your motivation high.

After struggling to raise additional capital from investors, Kenyan eCommerce startup, MarketForce, is raising $1 million on crowdfunding platform, Capitalize One year after announcing the close of its $40 million Series A, MarketForce has announced that it is raising $1 million via WeFunder. "When we started this journey, we committed to building an exceptional African company that empowers African people, communities, and economies, and this community round is one way to concretise that ideal. "We’re doing this because we believe that a company like MarketForce provides the opportunity to generate financial upside, not only for the merchants and partners that we serve, but also for people who understand and believe that what we are building is important for the continent," part of the announcement reads. The startup is accepting investments from as little as $1,000 at the same terms used for its Series A round. However, it says not all investors will receive their desired investment amount. Founded in 2018 by Tesh Mbaabu and Mesongo Sibuti, MarketForce is a B2B marketplace that provides distribution and financial services to merchants. Beginning with Kenya, the startup has since expanded into nearby countries, including Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda. It also has operations in Nigeria. The Y Combinator-backed startup serves more than 200,000 merchants in these five countries and has seen revenue grow from $140,000 in 2021 to $2.5 million in 2022, per its Capitalize listing.
It also plans to extend its services to four more countries. When MarketForce raised its Series A in 2022, it hoped to drive the number of merchants on its merchant super app, RejaReja, to a million by the end of 2022. However, those plans were affected after certain investors failed to send part of the equity investment promised to the startup. In response, it laid off 250 employees and restructured its business to optimise profitability. In an interview with TechCrunch in May 2023, Mbaabu, the startup's CEO, revealed that it had reduced the number of routes it covered from 700 to 400 to drive more efficiency, adding that the company was on track to record its highest revenues ever.

Kobo360 Founder, Obi Ozor, joins Enugu State cabinet as Commissioner for Transport Obi Ozor, the founder of Kobo360, has been appointed the Commissioner of Transport in Enugu State. Ozor, who co-founded Kobo360 with Ife Oyedele in 2017, was sworn in alongside 19 other commissioners by the Enugu State governor, Barr. Peter Mbah, on Thursday, August 10, 2023. At the swearing-in ceremony, the governor stated that the commissioners had been chosen based on their experience, track record, and backgrounds. He also expressed hope that residents of the state would begin to see results from the newly appointed commissioners within their first 100 days in office. “We expressed a massive vision that would see us growing our economy exponentially. We also promised our people to eradicate poverty and want to make Enugu State the premier destination for investment. Those are laudable and lofty ideas. But when we made those promises, we needed a team that will convey our people from where we are today to that destination we want to take them to. For this reason, the process that resulted in your selection was quite rigorous and detailed,” he said.
Ozor is the latest member of Nigeria’s startup ecosystem to be appointed to a political position after Bosun Tijani was included in the list of ministerial nominees sent by Nigeria’s president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. It's unclear if Ozor will be stepping away from his role as CEO of Kobo360, as there is no explicit requirement for political appointees from the private sector to leave their previous employment.

OAU, CU produced the highest number of 'millionaire' West African startup founders in the last decade On Monday, October 5, 2020, Techpoint Africa launched its West African Startup Decade Report. The report focuses on the funding activities of startups in the tech space between 2010 and 2019. It contains a breakdown of funding activities by startup industries, the origin of investors, and industry spotlight, among others. It is noteworthy that only Millionaire West African Startups (MWAS) -- startups in the West African region that raised $1 million cumulatively -- within the period under review were considered in the report. Zeroing in on the education of the startup founders revealed that Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) and Covenant University (CU) produced 12 and 6 alumni, respectively, to occupy first and second spot in the institution breakdown by first degree. Interestingly, a common trend was that MWAS founders from the same tertiary institution founded companies together. Kudi, for instance, has a couple of MWAS founders from the Obafemi Awolowo University; other startups with founders from OAU are TeamApt, Terragon, Farmcrowdy, 54gene, SlimTrader, and PropertyPro. Covenant University also produced founders whose startups -- PiggyVest, MDAAS, and Kora Network -- featured in the report. It would appear that these institutions either have a knack for producing alumni who go on to found successful startups or these alumni maintain a network, post-graduation, that allows them to come together and start these companies.
Whatever the reason, these institutions provided the most MWAS founders in the last decade. To find out more, get the West African Startup Decade Report. Featured image by Nick Fewings on Unsplash

How Bankly is Redefining Savings for Everyday People You know how they say opposites attract? Well, that's the perfect way to describe the friendship between myself and Susan, my lifelong 'Partner-in-Crime'. Susan and I couldn't be more different in our personalities, and that contrast has remained constant throughout our nearly two-decade friendship. While I tend to embrace a carefree and spontaneous attitude, Susan is the epitome of a calm, meticulous individual. She has an incredible eye for detail and an innate sense of organization. Despite our contrasting traits, Susan and I share a common passion for saving money. We often discuss various ways to manage our finances, and our latest challenge was particularly significant – planning and saving for her mother's upcoming 50th birthday celebration. The family had decided to mark this significant milestone with a special event. However, as much as her siblings were eager to contribute for the occasion, she had the burden of managing these contributions responsibly.
She contemplated revisiting "Ajo", an age-old communal savings tradition. This local savings method held the promise of a convenient way to pool money for the celebration. However, she knew from experience that the method had its flaws, and fraud was common. Introducing her siblings to an “Ajo” group was risky. If someone went away with their contributions, it could cause conflict between herself and her siblings. She had to find another way. Susan's pursuit of a solution led her to Bankly Microfinance Bank. They offered a Group Savings feature on the Bankly app that modernized the traditional "Ajo". It was like a bridge that connected the communal spirit of saving with the convenience of digital tools. With this feature, Susan could confidently rally her siblings to save towards the upcoming family event.
Bankly's Group Savings feature is an innovative approach to communal savings that creates transparency and accountability. It combines accessibility, user-friendly interface, and emphasis on transparency to give people like Susan a way out when they need to save for important needs. The Group Savings feature also offers a competitive annual interest rate of 15% accrued daily, providing an opportunity for steady, continuous growth over time. That’s not all. Users can set savings schedules, target amounts, and maturity dates for their group savings plan, fostering a sense of financial unity and shared responsibility. To create even more transparency, the Group Savings feature is equipped to provide members with instant notifications for deposits and withdrawals, ensuring everyone stays informed, which helps to give comfort to contributors and build trust within the group. True to its mission, Bankly Microfinance Bank is dedicated to reshaping the financial landscape and empowering individuals like Susan through product features that cater to everyday financial challenges. They are transforming the notion of savings from a chore, to a lifestyle that helps people achieve personal, family, and business growth.

Raven Bank Empowers 400,000 Students with Cutting-Edge ‘Feather Internet’ - Free WiFi on Campus Through the Feather Internet Initiative, Raven Bank has begun contributing to the educational sector by providing free WIFI across Nigerian campuses. The BAFI Award, 2022 Neo Bank of the Year, unveiled the Initiative on Friday during the maiden launch of Raven Feather Internet at the Ignatius Ajuru University, Rumolumeli, Port Harcourt, in Rivers State. Celebrating the impressive feat, Uchenna Nnodim, Chief Executive Officer of Raven Bank, revealed that this was the first step towards the bank’s goal of empowering over 400,000 students across Federal and State universities in the country with free high-speed broadband internet access to boost academic performance. He unveiled that the initiative emerged as a strategic remedy to address the prevalent digital divide resulting from limited internet access, a hurdle encountered by numerous Nigerian students. Drawing from his own educational journey, he candidly shared the obstacles he confronted in procuring online information. This, coupled with Raven's resolute commitment to enhancing financial literacy among Gen Z and millennials, spurred the imperative for this visionary initiative. He said, “We realised that about 70 per cent of Nigerian students do not have access to the internet. This is a large number. We are also very much aware that in modern times the volume of information and knowledge that exists on the internet cannot be overemphasised.”
“You can literally have access to any knowledge or information via the internet, so access to the internet is so crucial for educational and academic excellence.” Nnodim further noted that the maiden launch at IAUE was the initiative's first step. “Our launch today (Friday) was our maiden location, but we have big plans for the project. I have already stated we want to reach at least 400,000 students, and we have already mapped out 26 other locations we are exploring to expand.” “We are in talks with the management of these other locations, and the conversation is going smoothly. Our plan is to execute in these locations by the second quarter of 2024,” he added. The official launch of Raven Feather Internet commenced with an hour-long interactive workshop, hosted by Raven CFO Chidinma Maduwesi, featuring engaging dialogues on topics spanning savings, investments, entrepreneurship, and more. The esteemed workshop panel comprised Uchenna Nnodim, Raven CEO, Raven POS aggregator Benjamin Idisi, and Kelechi Godfrey, Financial Educator from The Boardroom. And students were captivated in the later half of the event by performances from selected artistes. Also in attendance at the launch was Professor Okey Okechukwu, Vice Chancellor of Ignatius Ajuru University of Education.
In his speech, he extolled the Raven management for their successful work in the implementation and execution of the Feather Internet initiative on campus. At the same time, commending the bank for choosing the institution for the pilot project. He further encouraged the students to take advantage of the free internet on campus, adding that the internet not only offers academic enrichment but also exposes students to a wide array of life skills, empowering them throughout their academic journey and beyond. Reaffirming the profound impact of Feather Internet, Nnodim expressed, “This programme is specifically targeted to have a high-level impact in the lives of Nigerian students.” “It is aimed at giving 400,000 Nigerian students access to free internet on daily bases; this is the maiden launch and just in one location; we intend to extend it to other Universities. The essence is to ensure that students have access to the internet for their academic pursuit, for research and to enable them to have access to any knowledge they have interest in.” Addressing the idea behind the name, he pointed out that the feathers of the majestic raven, the company’s mascot, birthed the name. Inspired by the swiftness of its wings, the team named the network transcending borders, redefining digital interaction after its feathers.

Glovo beats Jumia Food, Bolt Food, others to become one of Chicken Republic's delivery partners in Nigeria Glovo has today announced a partnership that will see it become one of Chicken Republic's delivery partners in Nigeria. The partnership, which began in August, will see Chicken Republic work with Glovo, ending partnerships with Jumia Food and Bolt Food. Furthermore, the partnership could be extended to Ghana, where both companies already operate. In Nigeria, Glovo currently operates in Lagos, Ibadan, and Abuja, where it works with 58 Chicken Republic outlets. On the other hand, Chicken Republic operates over 300 outlets across Nigeria, and one wonders if this partnership is a precursor to Glovo's expansion across Nigeria. However, Glovo executives have consistently reinforced their desire to focus on Lagos, Ibadan, and Abuja. Kofi Abunu, CEO of Food Concepts, expressed hope that the partnership will improve its customers' experience and improve deliveries, while Lamide Akinola, the newly appointed General Manager for Glovo Nigeria, also expressed delight at the partnership. "Since our initial collaboration with Chicken Republic in May 2022, we have demonstrated the ability to provide a fast and superior service for their customers. Thus, we are very proud that Chicken Republic, the leading QSR in Nigeria, has recognized our expertise and chosen us," Akinola said.
Since getting into the Nigerian market in 2021, Glovo has been on an aggressive expansion push, with billboards across the cities it serves. During a visit in May 2023, Glovo CEO, Oscar Pierre explained that the company's goal is to become a dominant player in Nigeria's quick commerce sector. Already, Glovo Nigeria employs more than 1,000 couriers and about 50 employees in the country. Additionally, Pierre disclosed that the startup has spent more than $3 million in Nigeria, even as he explained that the company's primary goal is to increase its customer base and improve its services. Glovo Nigeria's country manager expects the demand for on-demand delivery to continue despite increased operating costs

X (formerly Twitter) wants to take care of your legal fees When news about Bosun Tijani's ministerial nomination broke, Nigeria's tech ecosystem was filled with excitement. Tijani's CcHub, Nigeria's largest tech hub, played a major role in birthing some of the country's biggest tech companies from its humble beginnings in Yaba, Lagos. Having someone like Tijani represent the ecosystem at a ministerial level makes sense as he understands the plight of stakeholders in the space. His nomination, however, has been called into question by those who regard him as unpatriotic based on a post he made about Nigeria on X (formerly Twitter). ""Nigeria" is a bloody expensive tag to have against your name. Leave patriotism for a minute - that tag is a bloody waste of energy. A second foreign passport isn't sufficient to clean the "sin." He apologised during his ministerial screening and explained the circumstances that led to him making those posts. My colleagues and I have argued.
"He shouldn't have apologised because he did nothing wrong." "It's better for him to put his work above his ego." What would you have done if you were Tijani? Start your Monday with these stories: X's plan to cover your legal bills Wema + Nigeria to launch tech hubs Layoffs at Big Cabal Media X will take care of your legal fees if you're fired for your post On Sunday, August 6, 2023, X (previously Twitter) boss, Elon Musk, posted, "If you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform, we will fund your legal bill. No limit. Please let us know."
Isn't X in a mountain of debt? My first reaction to this tweet, I mean, post, was, "Lol" and here's why. X is currently owing $136,250 in unpaid rent at its HQ in San Francisco, USA. A report from the New York Times even indicates that X hasn't been paying rent in all its global offices as a cost-cutting measure. That's not all: X and Musk are currently facing lawsuits claiming $14 million in unpaid bills. Employees fired without severance are also suing for $500 million. Zoom out: Looking back at some of the things Musk has done, his post comes off as hypocritical. In November 2022, he fired an X engineer who called him out for an erroneous post he made about X. Several employees also made posts about being fired for exposing Musk's inaccurate statements about X. Wait: Before you make that post that could get you fired, remember Musk and how he says something one day and changes his mind the next.
Big Cabal Media reduces workforce by 19% Big Cabal Media, the parent company of TechCabal, Zikoko and Citizen, has laid off 19% of its workforce due to "harsh market conditions." In an internal memo to employees, Big Cabal Media CEO Tomiwa Aladekomo, said, "Today’s decision isn’t pleasant, but those leaving us can take pride in their work and their impact. For those of us who remain, know that we are as committed as ever to building one of the most important media businesses on the continent. That mission continues, and you can be proud to contribute to it.” Citizen, the company's new publication that focuses on governance and politics will be most affected by layoffs. The company said, "In a different business environment, we intended for Citizen to have 12-18 months to figure out sustained revenue streams." While it recorded 180% year-on-year revenue growth by the end of H1, economic realities such as a funding downturn and an economic slowdown, affected revenue projections. Big Cabal Media will now focus on TechCabal and TechCabal Insights and Zikoko. Nigeria partners with Wema Bank to launch digital hubs
Nigeria's federal government has partnered with Wema Bank to launch digital hubs in seven states. According to a statement by Olusola Abiola, Director of Information for Nigeria's Vice President, Kashim Shettima, the hubs will empower one million youths in the country with digital skills. He disclosed that Wema Bank's representatives and the vice president came up with the initiative after a recent meeting in Abuja. It starts with Lagos and Borno States: The first set of hubs will launch in Lagos and Borno States while other states, including Oyo and Cross River, will get theirs later. Dubbed the FGN/ALAT Digital and SkillNnovation Hub, it will support "tech-savvy youths with keen interest in digital innovations and aspire to drive technological advancements, by providing them with financial solutions, training and access to strategic partnerships."

FG Partners Wema Bank To Establish Digital and SkillNovation Hubs Across States Wema Bank, Nigeria's leading innovative bank, has partnered with the Federal Government of Nigeria to establish digital and skill innovation hubs across states in the country, with a target to empower one million youths with digital and other relevant skills. The initiative, known as FGN/ALAT Digital and SkillNovation Hub, was agreed upon during a meeting between representatives of the bank and Vice President Kashim Shettima in Abuja, aligning with President Bola Tinubu's administration’s commitment to creating more digital jobs for young Nigerians. Over the years, Wema Bank has been a pioneer in digital transformation within the banking industry, committed to fostering a culture of innovation, learning, and growth. Wema Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Moruf Oseni, says the innovative initiative is designed to revolutionize the way young entrepreneurs and employees interact with technology, entrepreneurship, and skill development. "The Digital & SkillNovation Hub reflects our dedication to fostering a thriving ecosystem that empowers Tech-Savvy Youth Entrepreneurs, Youth Entrepreneurs by Nature, and Young Employees, driving economic growth and sustainable progress across the nation. This centralized platform will integrate cutting-edge digital tools, technologies, and resources to streamline digital activities, collaboration, and information sharing," adds Oseni. According to a statement from the office of the Vice President, the Digital & SkillNovation Hub will first open in Lagos and Borno States, with Katsina, Cross River, Anambra, Oyo, and Kano states following suit. The initiative aims to provide financial solutions, training, and access to strategic partnerships, empowering young employees to become an integral part of Nigeria's workforce, especially those deployed through the NYSC. The statement adds that experts will mentor 500,000 SMEs across Nigeria, while coaches will provide training and up skilling for business growth.
Under the scheme, grants will be provided through a collaborative arrangement between the Federal Government and WEMA Bank, allocating N500 million to be given to SMEs and Techpreneurs. The FGN/ALAT Digital SkillNovation hubs will focus on training one million young adults in software engineering, product management, business analysis, cloud computing, and product design, using specialized resources.

Hacktivists declare cyber war on Nigeria Apple is going to launch its own AI chatbot, and it will be called Apple GPT. Apple has a way of joining technology trends and convincing its users that the tech never existed before. I really want to see how it will pull off Apple GPT. Sadly, it is not coming anytime soon. Like most things, Apple is taking its sweet time and will not be pressured into rolling out a technology or feature that is not perfect. Although a Bloomberg report told us in July that Apple GPT could be coming in 2024, Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo said it is still many years away. Regardless of when it comes out, I know Apple fanboys will find a way to make Apple GPT seem like AI chatbots never existed until the launch of Apple's While we wait for Apple to join the AI bandwagon, here's what I have for you today: Worldcoin is not giving up on Kenya
Hackers are coming for Nigeria Worldcoin plans to continue iris scans in Kenya On Wednesday, August 2, 2023, Kenyan authorities suspended the activities of Worldcoin, the crypto/blockchain project that wants to create an identity database for every human on the planet by scanning their iris. Despite the suspension, Worldcoin is not backing down. Wait, what's Worldcoin? If you're still fuzzy on what the whole Worldcoin project is all about, you can check out a brief description here. Anyway, Worldcoin, told TechCrunch that it is using this "pause" "to come up with better onboarding processes and crowd control measures. This is in addition to “work[ing] with local officials to increase understanding of the privacy measures and commitments Worldcoin implements." Co-founded by OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, Worldcoin has signed up over 350,000 Kenyans. Large crowds of people have been seen queuing up to scan their iris for a $50 signup bonus.
That's a lot of money: Yes, it is. And while Worldcoin launched officially a few weeks ago, it has secured $500 million in funding. Zoom out: Worldcoin's statement doesn't include an admission that its activities have been suspended in Kenya. For context, it said, “Out of an abundance of caution and in an effort to mitigate crowd volume, verification services have been temporarily paused.” Interestingly, Kenya's ICT minister, Eliud Owalo, already said Worldcoin's activities are within the law, so why the sudden u-turn? Hackers target vital Nigerian infrastructure A hacktivist group called Anonymous Sudan is planning a cyberattack that puts vital digital infrastructure in Nigeria at risk. The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), said in a press release that it detected the activities of the hacktivists and told the public to brace up for cyberattacks from the group. Why are they targeting Nigeria? I got into the group's Telegram channel, and they said they were mad at Nigeria because it decided to "stand with French Imperialists and Fight Niger."
They describe themselves as African hacktivists waging cyber war on behalf of oppressed Muslims all over the world. How worried should you be? Anonymous Sudan rarely misses when it hits. They hit Kenya recently and were able to hack the eCitizen portal, where Kenyan citizens can access services like driving licence renewal and visa renewal. They've already attacked MTN: On Wednesday morning, August 2, 2022, "Nigeria be prepared today" was posted on their Telegram channel. By afternoon, the group announced it had attacked "MTN telecom network in Nigeria. Partial outages and huge lag will be noticed." What is Nigeria doing about this? NITDA's computer emergency readiness and response team has advised government agencies on how to prevent attacks from Anonymous Sudan, but only time will tell if these measures will work.

Igniting Africa's Young Innovators: STEAM Fun Fest 2023 Sets New Records in STEAM Education! The third edition of the STEAM Fun Fest, held on July 22nd, 2023, proved to be a resounding success, captivating the hearts and minds of thousands of young innovators, problem-solvers, and leaders. This extraordinary event, organized by the visionary collaboration of Titi Adewusi (9ijakids), Jadesola Adedeji (STEM METS), Uchenna Onwuamaegbu-Ugwu (Edufun Technik), Wale Ogunjobi (Sabiteach), Kunmi Adenipebi (Gamr), and Bukola Akingbade (Kucheza), truly lived up to its reputation as the largest STEAM festival on the continent, igniting a passion for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) among the youth. The main objective of the STEAM Fun Fest is to empower the next generation with the essential skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the future of work and the digital age. During the event, over 4000 attendees had the opportunity to immerse themselves in a diverse array of STEAM activities, ranging from robotics, game design, virtual reality, and 3D modelling to animation, graphics design, and science experiments. The festival aimed to cultivate critical thinking, problem-solving, and the power of collaboration, all while inspiring a love for STEAM education among children ages 7-15 years. The event kicked off with a keynote by Iyin Aboyeji (CEO, Future Africa) who said that the purpose of STEAM education is for young minds who have STEAM knowledge in their individual fields to collaborate to provide a solution to social problems that affect real people rather than keeping the knowledge/ skills to themselves. There were other panel sessions from industry experts which included Malik Afegbua CEO of Slick City, Bode Abifarin CEO of Flutterwave, Oreoluwa Lesi Founder WTEC, Lanre Bamisebi, ED, Access Corporation and Jola Aderemi-Makinde, Google amongst others. This year’s event included new additions to the program such as a STEAM Competition Pitch and a Tech Career Corner where children had one on one chats about tech careers with professionals from top tech companies like Interswitch, MainOne, Jumia, Utiva, Flutterwave, and AltSchool. For the STEAM Competition Pitch, six finalists made up of children ages 9 -15 years pitched to a panel of judges the solutions to tackle problems with regard to Recycling, Environment, Sustainability, and Renewable Energy.
Kamdilichukwu Chukwuneta, a 9-year-old boy from Grace Saint School, Ikorodu, emerged as the STEAM Competition winner, taking home a brand-new laptop and a cash prize of N400,000. Throughout the day, the venue buzzed with a plethora of exciting activities – STEAM labs, Esport zone, drone soccer, and over 30 STEAM exhibitors. The STEAM Labs introduced children to Coding, Engineering, Robotics, Science Experiments, Animation, UI/UX design, AI Tools, and Game Development. The organizers extend heartfelt gratitude to the incredible sponsors: Access Bank, Argentil Capital, Lotus Bank, Flutterwave, Kibo, Flour Mills, The Place Restaurant, Hyde Energy, A.G Leventis, Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC), and MTN. The STEAM Funfest 2023 was made possible by your unwavering support. As the curtain falls on STEAM Fun Fest 2023, its impact resonates far beyond the event day. The passion for STEAM education instilled in young hearts, combined with the relentless pursuit of innovation and learning, ensures that Nigeria's future will be brighter, bolder, and filled with endless possibilities. Let's continue to celebrate and support initiatives like STEAM Fun Fest, as they inspire and equip Africa's young innovators to shape the future for generations to come.

CcHUB's Bosun Tijani gets ministerial nomination for President Tinubu's cabinet President Bola Tinubu has included Bosun Tijani, the co-founder and CEO of Nigeria's biggest tech hub, Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB), in the second batch of his ministerial list. This nomination marks a significant departure from a list laden with career politicians, past governors, and senators. Born on July 20, 1977, Tijani's tech journey began with a diploma in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Jos. His academic pursuits continued with a Master's degree in Information Systems and Management from Warwick Business School and a PhD in Innovation and Economic Development at the University of Leicester. Tijani's professional experience is equally impressive. From working as a Business Development Manager with DeliveryKing to serving as Deployment Lead (Africa) with Hewlett Packard (HP) Global Micro-enterprises Acceleration Programme (GMEAP), his contribution to the tech space is quite deep. He has managed learning centres across Africa and initiated significant projects, including Mark Zuckerberg's first visit to Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa as well as a meet up with Bill Gates, Founder of Microsoft. Under Tijani's leadership, CcHUB has grown from its humble beginnings in Yaba to acquiring major hubs across Africa, making it a pan-African tech incubator, empowering young people with the tools, communities, and capital they need to launch impactful ventures. With a billion naira growth fund, CcHub invests in early-stage founders building innovative products in Africa's education and healthcare systems.
Bosun Tijani as Minister of Communications and Digital Economy? Tijani's nomination suggests that he is being considered for the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy role. This move aligns with President Tinubu's focus on Nigeria's tech ecosystem during his campaign, but that's not the only option. Tijani's extensive experience and innovative mindset could also make him a key competitor for other ministries. His background in economics, coupled with his tech expertise, positions him as a potential candidate for overseeing ministries related to economic development or education. However, in the context of the proposed ministry, Bosun Tijani's profile is not the only option among the list of ministerial nominees. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo's profile also stands out as a strong contender for the position of ICT minister. With an extensive background in electronics and communication engineering, a successful career as the CEO of Matrix IT Solutions Limited, and political experience as a member of the House of Representatives, Tunji-Ojo's qualifications align perfectly with the role. The nomination of tech leaders like Tijani could be a promising shift in Nigeria's political landscape. It not only acknowledges the importance of the tech industry but also paves the way for innovative and forward-thinking governance.
As the Senate continues the screening process, the tech community and the nation at large eagerly await the final decision, hopeful for a future where technology and innovation take centre stage in Nigeria's development.

More calls for stakeholder collaboration as the digital transformation center hosts a policy dialogue on the Nigerian Startup Act The GIZ/Digital Transformation Center (DTC), in partnership with the European Union and the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), organised a digital policy dialogue session with the Nigerian Startup Act (NSA) in focus. DTC Nigeria aims to foster inclusive discussions and gather valuable insights from stakeholders to create an effective framework that promotes innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainable economic growth within the Nigerian startup ecosystem and digital economy. The productive session, which was held in Lagos on Thursday, July 27, 2023, brought stakeholders from the public and private sectors together in one room to discuss ways to foster the adoption of the Nigeria Startup Act nationwide. Present at the policy dialogue was Dr. Thuweba Diwani, Head, GIZ/Digital Transformation Center (DTC) Nigeria, who delivered the welcome address. She said the Nigerian startup will not only create an enabling environment but also increase capacity building and accelerate development. That's why it's important for stakeholders to work together to ensure the success of the Startup Act. The session also had addresses from Markus Wauschkuhn, Sustainable Economic Development Cluster (SEDEC) coordinator, GIZ Nigeria, and Inga Stefanowicz, Head of Section, Green and Digital Economy, EU Delegation to Nigeria and the ECOWAS. Dr. Aminu Lawal Muhammad, Special Adviser to the Director General of NITDA on digital transformation, spoke extensively on the Nigeria Startup Act and its effects on digital transformation in Nigeria. He discussed the work that has been done, adding that continuous work and support will continue to come from NITDA.
Tracy Okoro-Isaac, State Adoption Lead for the Nigeria Startup Act, took the audience through the journey that led to the Nigeria Startup Act, from the call for volunteers to the continuous pushing of boundaries and accomplishment of milestones upon milestones leading up to the signing of the act. She summarised some of the provisions of the act, adding that it was designed to greatly benefit startups and that the government is actively supporting them given that the act holds all stakeholders accountable. A panel session moderated by Justina Oha, Founder and CEO, Digital Equity Africa, with panellists Amina Lawal, DevOps Engineer, Hostspace; Ized Uanikhehi, Founder, Zedi Africa; Engineer Yakubu Musa, Acting National Coordinator, ONDI NITDA; Amal Hassan, Co-vice chair of the implementation committee; Charles Emembolu, co-founder and director, Roar Nigeria Hub; and Amina Lawal, DevOps Engineer and Co-founder, Hostspace, took a deep dive into the impact of the Nigeria Startup Act on the innovation-driven economy. Amal discussed some of the benefits of the act given that it protects startup founders and provides them with the kind of support older businesses would have loved to have when they started out, using her early business venture as an example. Amina was able to point out the need for continuous training and the provision of jobs for the trained individuals. She also called for the need to create an enabling environment and provide the necessary infrastructure for tech-enabled businesses to thrive. Musa, speaking from NITDA’s position, said that they are working with state governments to get them to implement the Nigerian Startup Act in their respective digital transformation plans. He said they are working to get the states to create their own startup acts, using the national startup act as a blueprint. Ized called for increased participation in local communities where all stakeholders are present and the government increases engagement and continues to build trust. The panellists and the audience agreed that all the stakeholders in the act need to meet each other fully because each citizen has a stake in the act, citing that the government cannot do it alone.
So the success of the act will depend on the continuous collaboration of all stakeholders. Charles called for more local investment and the creation of an enabling environment to incentivize local investors to invest in local startups. Ized also called for the government to ensure that startups are protected from new policies that may contradict the Nigeria Startup Act. Oswald Guobadia, Nigeria Startup Implementation Committee Lead, contributed to the conversation, saying that responsibility lies on the desk of NITDA to increase state adoption of the Startup Act given that it’s their responsibility according to the provisions of the act. As the event was drawing to a close, a focus group discussion was held. The participants were broken into four groups with the aim of gathering insights for the development of a participatory policy implementation framework. Each group focused on development processes, stakeholders, capacity building, policy implementation, technology as an enabler, and monitoring and evaluation of the startup act, respectively. Each group presented their solutions, which were deliberated upon during the discussion, with NITDA taking note of the feedback. The dialogue came to a close with more calls for capacity building, effective feedback mechanisms, more engagement between public and private sector stakeholders, and increased awareness and education on the provisions of the Nigerian Startup Act.

A Look Back At Quidax’s Milestones As It Celebrates 5 Years Quidax, an African cryptocurrency exchange, has hit a major milestone as the company marks its fifth year of official operation. To celebrate the achievement, Quidax is offering free Naira deposits and withdrawals to its customers from August 1st to 7th. Between this period, all customers - whether old or new - will be able to deposit and withdraw Naira for free across all of the company’s channels. The accomplishment isn’t a minor one. Official data from the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics shows that 65% of businesses fail in the first five years. And, Quidax has been able to fight through several challenges of its own in the past few years. Let’s walk through some of the company's most notable moments. Official Launch Quidax was launched in 2018 by Buchi Okoro (Co-Founder/CEO), Uzo Awili (Co-Founder/CTO), and Morris Ebieroma (Co-Founder/CIO).
Okoro, an alumnus of Covenant University, Ota, explained that he had developed the vision for Quidax following an unfortunate personal experience he had while trading cryptocurrencies. “I had started trading cryptocurrencies while in school, and I got scammed on a specific transaction. While I was hurt by the experience, I also realized that thousands of people fall victim to fraud in the crypto space. My goal with Quidax was to create a platform where people could trade and transact using crypto safely.” Together with Awili and Ebieroma - also students at Covenant University - Okoro set out to create Quidax. And, after getting some seed money and entering the Techstars Accelerator Program in 2018, the company got off the ground. Initial Expansion The first two years for Quidax were filled with significant expansion. At the time, the crypto market had been battling through one of its worst periods, with coin prices tumbling after hitting massive highs in 2016 and 2017. Nevertheless, this period also saw a lot more people learning about cryptocurrencies - especially in Africa.
And, this curiosity saw them get more involved in the space. Soon enough, Quidax had achieved an enviable customer base and was growing massively. Navigating the CBN Ban This growing company met its first major challenge in February 2021 as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced a ban on crypto-banking relationships. At the time, the apex bank placed a restriction on banks having affiliations with cryptocurrencies of any kind. This meant that crypto companies, traders, and businesses accepting cryptocurrencies had their bank accounts shut down immediately. Considering that crypto is still a growing space, this ruling was concerning for many of Quidax’s customers. Nevertheless, Quidax was able to find a way through this. The company launched a peer-to-peer service, making it possible for customers to deposit and withdraw funds safely. The service, called Qdirect, provides an added benefit of trust - instead of transacting with an unknown person, you’re directly making transactions with Quidax.
This way, customers are assured of a smooth, secure transaction. QDX Token Launch In May 2021, Quidax also hit a major milestone after the company launched its in-house crypto token, QDX. The asset marked a first for the African crypto space, offering benefits such as rewards and staking to the exchange’s customers. Despite a slowing market, the QDX launch was met with significant excitement, and Quidax raised $3 million in additional funding from that launch in a single day. The launch of the token was also accompanied by the launch of the QDX Vault - Quidax’s staking service. With the QDX Vault, Quidax users can stake their QDX and earn rewards from airdrops and other promotional campaigns from the exchange. Don Jazzy Unveiling & BBN Campaign Quidax’s continued growth went into 2022, with the company embarking on several impressive marketing initiatives to improve its reach and brand impact. Part of that was the unveiling of Michael Collins - popularly known as Don Jazzy - as its official brand ambassador.
Jazzy, who is one of Nigeria’s foremost music producers and industry executives, helped drive Quidax’s brand marketing efforts, participating in numerous campaigns as the company grew to become one of the trusted names in crypto. Quidax was also an official partner for 2022’s edition of Big Brother Naija - Africa’s most popular reality game show. Dollar Savings Pivot Another milestone for Quidax has been the launch of its Dollar Savings tool. Announced in September 2022, the product provides a way for customers to convert their money into U.S. Dollars, save it, and earn up to 10% in interest annually. The tool couldn’t have launched at a better time. The Nigerian Naira lost over 20% of its value against the Dollar in 2022, and it is on track to lose even more this year. With inflation also reaching all-time highs, Quidax’s Dollar Savings tool provides the perfect way for anyone to protect their money - and earn attractive returns while they’re at it. Just as well, it provides a way for Quidax to cater for its customers who might be a bit wary of the crypto market. As the industry works to recover from another bearish market, many customers who might want to wait out the storm but are still looking for a way to earn have the perfect opportunity with the Dollar Savings tool.
This year, the company improved on the service even more, making it possible for customers to withdraw money from their Dollar Savings plans and USD wallets into their Domiciliary accounts. Quidax’s accomplishments as the company turns five have been impressive, to say the least. And, as the crypto market looks set for a recovery, the company has proven itself to be a reliable, safe place for anyone looking to get into the space.

Lessons from the Diary of a Nigerian eCommerce Startupper “Keep showing up every day and trying to get better. Don’t count yourself out." Every moment is a lesson for us as entrepreneurs, and in the startup world where things move so fast, it would be a sad thing to be left behind. My team and I had quite a tough time taking off on the eCommerce runway, especially being an online marketplace for building materials. So far so good, but we are still aiming for the best. Here are some of the lessons I have learnt from running an eCommerce marketplace. Pick your niche Each time I mention to people that Cribpark is an eCommerce platform, they give the look of, “again? Another eCommerce platform?”
But when I add that we are an eCommerce marketplace for building materials, they go, “hh, that’s cool. A new twist to eCommerce”. With Jumia and Konga having raised about hundreds of millions of dollars between them, you are better off picking a niche or you will just be a poor man’s Konga.com. When you pick a niche, pick one you understand quite well and be the best at it. Even Amazon started as an online bookstore. When we started as an eCommerce for building materials we realised most of our early clients were people who were building for the first time. They knew little about construction and didn’t want to be held captive by their contractor’s advice. Since our team is dominated by civil engineers, it was easy for us to give them information about the materials they were buying that their suppliers and contractors did not know. They were not just paying for the product, they were also getting free valuable information. Picking a niche helps you to focus your best effort, and you really don’t want to be spread too thin.
Remember those days when shopping started and ended in Yaba market; if you were just shopping for jeans, you were more likely to buy from someone who only sold jeans in his/her shop, than the one who sold all types of clothes including jeans. Create a brand Your brand is your promise to your customer, it is what they expect from your company when they think about you. It may sound too early talking branding, but you will reap the benefits early too. You want to understand what your brand is? Well, ask your customers to leave an anonymous feedback. Last year I had a meeting with one of our B2B customers, Engineer Ken. He was referred to us by a B2B customer and had done a transaction of over ₦1 million. Towards the end of the year he had been so impressed with our performance and asked us to have a meeting. We discussed for about an hour and you’d think it was a friendly reunion even though it was our first time seeing each other.
We discussed the building industry, attitude of suppliers and laughed about our first delivery. What happened in our first delivery? The supplier supplied an inferior quality of sharp sand but Engineer Ken wasn’t on site during delivery. Normally, we only pay suppliers when customers indicate satisfaction, but since he okayed the delivery, we paid the supplier. On getting to site to see the quality of sand he was less than impressed. He called us to state his displeasure and how the supply would implicate him as a contractor. We were concerned and ordered the supplier back to the site. The supplier agreed that the quality didn’t meet the requirements he promised. The sand would have to be used for another site purpose than they intended. Instantly we paid Engineer Ken 50% back for what he paid for.
We would later deduct the money from the supplier from other deliveries he made. The money couldn’t change the situation, but at least it showed we cared more about his project than our profit. That was also the last time we had such issues as we had to tighten our loose ends. During the meeting, Engineer Ken talked about how he was impressed with how we handled the situation and always ensured the suppliers did the right thing. Through his words and other clients’, we could see they saw us as a reliable company that puts customer first ahead of every sale. Customers are not dumb, they know when you put them first, and they return because you gave them an experience and not a product. Such mistakes may happen once in a blue moon, but it is in such cases brand promises are verified. Show what your brand is, don’t tell. Yes we lost about ₦20,000, but it is nothing compared with what we gained from him in over 8 repeat sales. Go the extra mile
Call Cribpark at anytime and we are ready. We have received calls by 6am, 10pm, 11pm and once by 1am. When they apologised for calling us late, we were quick to let them know it was no problem for us at all. I remember a weekend I had the customer care number with me, it was a few minutes past 1 am on a Sunday morning and I received a call. I checked the time, picked the call, and didn’t act like it was unusual. The customer was on our site checking all the items he wanted to buy and I had the pleasure of running him through our value offering. It happened that he was looking for a single place he could buy all his sanitary wares and other furniture fittings for his new house. We talked for almost half an hour and sealed a deal worth millions through it. As a startup, there is no point forming office hours except you have another guarantee of salary at the end of the month. Our office hours are anytime a customer is able to reach us, through calls, emails, or even in our dreams.
As long as we can be reached, we are open. The extra mile is a huge differentiating factor for startups to break out and it could come in different ways. We had a client who was running out of sand on the day he was constructing his German floor. He called us by 12 noon and said he needed it by 2pm. We once did same day delivery for him, but even this was a challenge. We called the supplier closest to him and were able to convince him to make the delivery out of his existing busy schedule. We called our client back to say we wouldn’t make the 2pm delivery but 3pm was possible. He was excited we could even promise to deliver as you don’t normally find it easy getting such items during the day except you ordered a day before. We delivered by 2.55pm and till today he remains one of our best customers. Word going round says we are his most reliable supplier too.
Repeat purchases from him are over 17 across 9 months. Do what works for you If you don’t know the way, follow those who have been there, over time you will discover the path to follow. When we fully launched in June last year, we developed quite a robust infrastructure for people to visit the website, browse easily and make an order. One of our mentors was a UI/UX lead in Oracle who gave us unique insights; our interface was awesome. To our surprise we realised that most users would visit the platform, browse through the products and rather than click “add to cart” would prefer to call our customer care. After the first transaction, most repeat orders from these customers would continue on Whatsapp. Infact most users asked if they could chat with us on Whatsapp. They completely bypassed our designed order process. Chat might just be key in the future of eCommerce customer relations because people want a more personal experience.
Overtime, when we realised people liked to have the phone numbers more than “adding to cart” we simply made our phone numbers more visible on the site and same thing applied to our marketing efforts. Marketing We started using Facebook and Twitter and SEOs. Great tools. Facebook helped us reach a lot of people and had a decent conversion while twitter got more engagements but with little or no conversion. Overtime we were running out of money and we had to look for other ways of gaining new audiences without costs. We tried Nairaland as the posts were free anyway, we secured a partnership with a major classified Ads site, and also did some on-ground marketing. It worked! We had new customers and more sales. Sometimes not having what you want makes you more creative. Now we explore more of content marketing as we have realised that it creates a bond with the target customer and also helps break down trust barriers. If you are running on a low budget and are quite creative, you should try a mix of different platforms and strategies.
The world is not a plain surface; don’t stick to the status quo, for it is your duty to create your audience. Be the marketplace please! It was February last year when we had just decided to pivot into building materials and be a marketplace. The following week Cristina Stenbeck, the chairwoman of Kinnevik was in Rwanda. Kinnevik owned Millicom which owned our incubator in Rwanda then, so Ms. Stenbeck decided to pop-in and have a discussion with the innovators. It was an opportunity to learn from someone who had invested over $2 billion in eCommerce. We told her about our initial foray into home furniture and services and our decision to focus on being a hyper-local marketplace for building materials. She was impressed to hear we would be a marketplace and explained from her experience that the eCommerce marketplaces was easier for startups than the traditional eCommerce model as there was very little or no inventory and logistics to worry about. For someone with huge experience in eCommerce, validating the marketplace and business model meant a lot to us and in reality it turned out the right path to tread. Focus on the right metrics
There are many metrics that matter to a startup, but focus on the most important. For me, I believe beyond the GMVs, LTVs, and CACs, the customer success is the most important. Why? Because we might be in business to make money, but since we are not robbing people, we have to make money by making customers happy. It makes no sense to acquire 100 customers in January and 99 don’t bother to buy from you again. How many customers have you had? How many have come back to buy? How many of those who came back have referred you to other customers? Customer retention is very important and to achieve it, don’t just focus on selling but give your customers an experience they can’t get on other platforms. Give them a reason to come back. Don’t let your customers feel they clicked the wrong link again.
Most times people only come back when they have been well served or you are solving more of their problems. Run lean In our first 6 months of eCommerce operations, we focused on furniture, interior decor and home services. We made just $1,000 in revenue and then we got seed investment of $15,000 from our incubator. We pivoted to building materials and now that we are in our 9th month as eCommerce marketplace for building materials, we have had sales transactions of about $150,000, and spent just about $5,000 running the business. We are currently a team of 3 working full-time and we have spent less than $500 on marketing. Having team members with diverse competencies has been a huge benefit as it lowered our cost of personnel. Running lean is important because funding may not come as expected, market demand may fluctuate and some assumptions might be painfully unreal, but the reality is that if you run lean you will have a low burn rate and a high run way. This gives you enough time to test your model, make several iterations and be prepared for scaling up. Running lean simply means looking out for the most, in a less costly but highly effective way to run your business so that you don’t quickly run out of money.
There are a limited number of times you can lean on friends and family for financial support, so if you don’t run lean and grow the right numbers, you may have a good product but you would have had to close down long before striking gold is in view. Warning: By the time you are done running lean, you may end up looking like a fashion model, but at least you have a sound business model. FAIL FAST, SCALE I didn’t quite understand what failing fast meant though I was using to the word. It is this simple: As entrepreneurs we think we know our industry quite well and understand the pain points, so we design a solution. Overtime we realise that in most cases though the need is there, but customers are just not buying into us. Then we sit down to understand the customer better and design a process that follows the customer’s footprint. This often means trying different things most of which will fail, but you only have to get it right a few times. Since you are going to fail in most features anyway, why not fail fast so you quickly know what doesn’t work and then focus on what works. At the beginning it is also important to do what works even if it doesn’t scale, as that may quickly differentiate you from others and make you unique.
Those little things like extra attention you give the customer may not all be doable when you scale, but at least you will get the numbers that makes scaling the next logical step. Final Words Am I sharing these business experiences and tips like someone who has finally arrived? Capital NO!. In this part of the world, we tend to think that writing a book, giving tips and talking at seminars to eager audiences is only a duty for those who have ‘made it big’ and have gotten it all perfected. Well, I do not belong to that school of thought. There is need for shared peer experiences. My experiences till date as CEO and co-founder of this unique eCommerce business niche have been filled with an almost balanced share of ups and downs. The simple truth is that success has no silver bullet. What has worked for me and my team is the fact that we have a vision to cause a great change in a very active and viable business industry and we are committed to it. So, we stick it out and keep celebrating our successes and learning from our failures.
If you are into eCommerce business in Nigeria today, I say, may the odds favour you. Cheers to more successes ahead!

Cribpark is building the Uber of building materials in Nigeria Have you ever purchased building materials from a next door vendor and somehow felt cheated? Or have you ever felt awkward when you have to chart a separate bargain for delivery? Maybe you were forced to let go of the entire purchase when no agreement was reached for delivery? It's probably worse when you’re dealing with large quantity purchase of such items, especially where as a buyer, you are visiting the market for the first time. It could certainly get annoying. However, one startup is offering a disruptive approach to nipping those entire worrisome dilemmas in the bud. Introducing Cribpark Founded by Oludare Pius, Cribpark.com.ng is Nigeria’s first state-of-the-art online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of housing products, like building materials, at discounted prices with 24-hour free delivery at the most. The platform provided by Cribpark not only allows homeowners and potential builders purchase variety of valuable building materials, but also gives them access to price listing by different vendors from different geographical locations, and as such eliminating the excesses of over ambitious agents/vendors.
The business is an offshoot of previously adopted similar models. After market testing and risk analysis, it was pivoted in June 2015 to being a marketplace for housing products (Building materials) which is seen as having a linear approach and scalable potential, especially in an already saturated market like Nigeria where building materials are acquired almost on daily basis for various building needs. Market and value Having had a firsthand study of the market, Cribpark observed that the housing market in Nigeria is being driven by an increasing demand from the middle class – usually tech savvy and mostly online through their mobile devices -- most of whom either do not have the luxury to visit the traditional building market or are visiting the market for the first time. The suppliers -- dominated by old and/or semi-literate people -- on the other hand see the process of leveraging on technology to meet demand with supply as being cumbersome. However, Cribpark’s unique approach to tackling this challenge is by providing 24-hour delivery, acting as a hyper-local market that enables price comparison of products of various geographical locations from one single source (cost saving conveniences) and ensuring quality of products. This it calls the triple constraints. Working Algorithm The process begins with a vendor acquisition, which is essential in capturing their interest and creating the much needed mutually beneficial relationship between all parties. Cribpark then goes ahead to create a vendor relationship support team to work with these vendors.
The support team goes ahead to meet the vendor, create a profile for them and upload it in a way the buyers who are internet savvy can understand. As a result, internet savvy buyers are able to communicate online with internet illiterate vendors through its provided support layer that bridges the digital divide. “Initially what we planned was that they would sign up themselves, but we realise that most building material dealers are not IT really savvy, so we support them in helping creating a profile that communicate with the kind of customers that we have,” Oludare explained. And because it’s a market place, many vendors can sell the same item, thereby creating an internal competition among vendors and hence price moderation. The mutual relationship ensures discounted prices for buyers and ready market online for the vendors. Funding Cribpark Systems Ltd is incorporated in Nigeria (March 2014) and like most startups, started off bootstrapping and relying on hands-on skills to lower the cost of running the business at the initial stage. The Rwandan subsidiary -- Cribpark Rwanda -- was created after Cribpark was selected among the 4 African startups into Millicom’s Tech Incubator. Millicom provided seed investment of $15,000 for the 6 months incubation period in Rwanda (November, 2014 – April, 2015). Another interesting fact about the startup is how it self-raised $5000 after the initial investment got exhausted and is still maintaining its lean budget.
While the business is still looking to continue bootstrapping and increase sales till they are ready for the next investment, it is interesting to note that the company achieved a gross merchandise volume of $70,000 dollars from a marketing budget of just $350 in its first seven months. Cement, sand and granite have accounted for over 70% of sales. Challenges In this part of the world, we wouldn’t stop talking about the issue of trust, and it’s been no different for Cribpark. On the part of the vendor, Oludare explains, “ it’s hard convincing vendors especially because they inquire about the immediate benefits .” The company solved this by going through the major distributors rather than using the companies. The customers on the other hand want to see variety on the platform, especially in terms of user interaction. The company had to adopt pay on delivery in order to create trust in the customer. Cribpark further had to introduce a buyer protection policy that provides escrow services for customers; payment is only to be remitted to vendor upon 100% validation of the product as satisfactory condition in the eye of the customer. Prospects
Cribpark is heavily focused on areas like Ikorodu, Aja, Festac, Ibafo and Mowe, as these are areas with strong demand for building materials. But it is looking at capturing the entirety of Lagos within the next 6 months, and then Abuja and Port Harcourt combined in the another 6 months. “These markets represents between 55-60% of the construction industry in Nigeria,” Oludare says, Following up on that would be securing interest in places like Rwanda; where it had its incubation, and leveraging on its partnership with Millicom to scale there, before extending to other eastern African countries. The company also intends to add to its vendor list, by conducting another round of vendor acquisitions. Read guest post by Oludare Pius: Lessons from the Diary of a Nigerian eCommerce startupper

Nigerian healthtech startup, Remedial Health, raises $12 million in Series A funding to expand the reach of its services Nigerian healthtech startup, Remedial Health, has raised $12 million in Series A funding — $8 million in equity and $4 million in debt — to expand the reach of its services in the country. The company will also use the funds to support the delivery of targeted financial services to drive business growth across Nigeria’s pharmaceutical sector. QED Investors and Ventures Platform co-led the equity funding round. While this is the former’s second investment in an African startup, the latter has invested in Remedial Health since the pre-seed stage. It is also Ventures Platform's first Series A investment. Gaingels, Tencent, and Ycombinator participated after taking part in earlier rounds. A consortium of local and international financial institutions led the $4 million debt financing. Launched in 2022 by Samuel Okwuada (CEO) and Victor Benjamin (COO), Remedial Health is a tech startup digitising the pharmaceutical supply chain. The B2B company provides software for pharmacies and hospitals to manage their inventory and sales.
The company helps pharmacies source pharmaceutical products for their shelves from major manufacturers and distributors, including GSK, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Emzor, and Fidson Healthcare. It also offers inventory financing to pharmacies or hospitals that lack the necessary funds to purchase needed drugs. For pharmaceutical manufacturers, Remedial Health provides an effective route-to-market for their products and data-driven insights into local markets that they can leverage for more effective planning and decision-making. Nigerian healthtech startup, Remedial Health, is digitising the pharmaceutical supply chain and offering inventory financing to pharmacies Remedial also has an online shop that allows pharmacy owners who do not use its software to place orders via its mobile app. Store owners can use the mobile app to access over 8,000 vetted products, with same-day delivery and inventory financing to reduce cash-flow friction for routine orders and maximise sales opportunities. When Remedial announced its $4.4 million seed funding in September 2022, Okwuada revealed that the startup was already operating in 16 states of Nigeria and had plans to spread to the rest of the country. Now, the company says it works with over 300 manufacturers and serves over 5,000 hospitals, pharmacies, and Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) across 34 of Nigeria's 36 states. When asked how the company had expanded into most states in Nigeria in less than a year, the CEO said he observed the country and now understands how the business works. He added that the company wanted to reach as many people as possible.
Further, he stated while the company distributes in all 36 states, it hasn't hired staff in two locations. Meanwhile, achieving that came with challenges, and Okwuada described it as a “logistical nightmare.” "Moving an item on the road is a logistical nightmare, from finding a third-party partner — if you need one — to poor roads to the removal of fuel subsidies, resulting in an increase in fuel to consumers that you cannot pass on 100%, to law enforcement on the road who are there to demand extortion." However, he claims that the company understands the challenge and knows how the country works, albeit not completely, but to a high enough level that it can successfully distribute across all states. Since receiving seed funding, the company has increased its headcount by twofold, its revenue by five times, and its customer base by three times. What's more, Remedial plans to expand its existing offerings with new services, including payments and primary healthcare services like doctor visits or remote diagnostics.

Healthlane raised $2.4m, then went from a great workplace to owed salaries, layoffs, and fund diversions. Now it’s reportedly raising a Series A When Cameroonian healthtech startup, HEALTHLANE BY GIFTEDMOM LIMITED (Healthlane), officially launched in Nigeria on November 9, 2021, our Managing Editor, Emmanuel Paul, attended the event at the Healthlane office in Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria. At the launch event, it was said that Alain Nteff (CEO) and Agbor Ashumanyi Ako (Co-founder and Medical Director) started Healthlane in Cameroon in 2019 to help Africans get quality and affordable healthcare services. One of Healthlane’s in-house physicians revealed that the startup provided up to 78 different tests, with results normally out in 45 minutes. The company offered a feeding, supplement, or exercise plan from the results of the tests. So, in 2022, some Techpoint Africa employees — Chimgozirim Nwokoma, Yinka Awosanya, Emmanuel Paul, and Precious Mogoli— used the platform. While Mogoli, Nwokoma, and Paul signed up for a full-body check-up plan, Awosanya signed up to get his Hepatitis B vaccination. But when, in September, Awosanya wanted to take the last dose of the vaccine, he noticed worrying signals suggesting that Healthlane might not be working. “The initial response was that the doctor wasn’t around,” Awosanya recalls, “Later, I was told that their office was being renovated and that they’d come to my house or office to administer it. But they never did.
And afterwards, their app stopped working.” Between August and September, I received two different diagnoses from two doctors via Techpoint Africa’s HMO service. I was wondering how accurate their diagnoses were. Besides, I was given some medications, which I discontinued due to the distinct difference in diagnosis. Seeking a second opinion, I wanted to run some tests to confirm the diagnoses, so I downloaded the Healthlane app from the Google Play Store only to realise it was not working. It was also curiously missing on the Apple App Store. I began reaching out to the company's current and former employees, and what I discovered was bigger than what I feared. But, before I take you through this exposé, let's go back to the beginning. In the beginning The official story is that Healthlane was launched in 2019.
However, according to multiple sources, it did not launch in either Cameroon or Nigeria until 2021, a year after raising a $2.4 million seed investment in 2020. Meanwhile, Alain Nteff said he co-founded mobile health platform, GiftedMom Limited (GiftedMom), in 2012, which later pivoted to Healthlane in March 2019. But according to one of our sources, Healthlane was incorporated as GiftedMom in 2015, not 2012. A GSMA article, which lists GiftedMom as a portfolio startup, appears to corroborate this claim. According to the source, the startup changed its shareholders and closed its Yaoundé branch on an unknown date. In 2021, it hired some employees to work in Douala. Consequently, Douala operations started between July and August of the same year. Several sources maintain that Healthlane had a great work culture when it first launched in 2021 in Nigeria and Cameroon. So much so that many were willing to work past their scheduled shifts to ensure that the company's operations ran smoothly. “We just had this good work environment where we were all friends amongst ourselves.
We were hopeful, and everybody kept pushing the product out because we knew we would benefit from it if we made a lot of sales,” a source familiar with the matter says. Employees in Nigeria had access to the company’s fitness facilities. There were also complimentary fruits, salads, and lunch, with the company covering half the cost of lunch. The company also promised the employees a retreat later in 2022. But none of these perks, however, prepared them for "the termination" and "unfriendly work environment" that was to come. Also, the retreat never happened. According to a source, in Cameroon, the company's initial goal was to use preventive telemedicine to help people live longer and better lives. But, their business model "had no marketing and sales strategy and relied solely on faith." A shift in work culture A source claims that "currently, the work culture is nothing but lack of communication (silence), lying, implementation without consulting relevant opinions, and unnecessary meetings and headaches."
But how did a company with an excellent work culture suddenly change? Moreover, multiple sources mention that the company has no structure or direction regarding Healthlane’s method, goals, or strategy. For instance, a source says, “The company in Cameroon was so confused that they began imitating what was being done in industrialised nations, failing to recognise that our markets were different. When they realised there were no sales, they even considered turning the place into a clinic.” But that alleged lack of structure and direction was just the beginning. By multiple accounts, salaries used to be paid before the end of the month, until December 2021, when management informed the team that they would shut down early for the Christmas break. All staff were also asked to take a compulsory five-day work leave during the break. “The company enforced the five-day work leave on everyone”, an ex-employee informs Techpoint Africa. On December 16, 2021, Healthlane held its end-of-the-year party on its premises with its staff and vendors. Multiple sources reveal that following that, none of the staff received their salary by December ending.
Salaries are delayed and owed “For a company that just started in August 2021, there were a lot of ups and downs,” a source says. Nteff reportedly assured the team that the company had funds to cover its operations until early January 2022. So, they always wondered what the “real explanation” was for the company failing to pay staff and vendors and to remit taxes and pensions deducted from staff salaries. Multiple sources confirm that at the beginning of January 2022, there was zero communication from management about why salaries were delayed. Later in the month, employees began to raise eyebrows. “It wasn’t until sometime in January that we were told the company had ‘some minimal cash flow issues’,” a source recalls. While some employees received their December salaries later in January 2022, some received in February. Healthlane reportedly rinsed and repeated the process for January's salaries, and by May, the Nigerian arm had begun delaying salary payments again. As of publication time, the company reportedly owes its Nigeria-based employees four months' salary since July.
Per a source, one of the employees in Cameroon informed “management” that they would suspend their responsibilities until they receive at least two months of the five months' salary owed. “Management”, however, reacted by “instructing security not to allow them into the office” while it removed them from work platforms. It also informed the labour office in Cameroon that the employee had “abandoned their responsibilities without notice.” According to a Nigerian source, "At some point in 2022, we stopped hearing from the office. Since it seems that the management makes these decisions on their own, we stopped hearing from them. They don't carry you along. They don’t respond. They don’t follow up." Per another source, employees kept complaining about how information wasn't getting out during the general meeting. They wondered why it was so difficult to communicate with employees about what was happening.
They simply wanted to know why the startup was not performing as expected, but “the co-founders wouldn’t tell them the truth.” Multiple sources complain about hardly getting responses from “management” whenever they reach out to them. Apparently, co-founder Ashu always referred them to CEO Nteff whenever they reached out to him, indicating that he had no say in the matter. Layoffs and resignations While the company had a great work culture before December 2021, sources say that there were a few red flags which they overlooked. In September 2021, for instance, the CEO reportedly fired an employee, who was later reinstated with a reduced salary and demoted, only to have their appointment terminated within a month. "Workplace instability has been one of the company's key weapons,” a source reveals, “The situation has grown since the beginning of the year for a number of reasons combined with delayed and late unpaid pay since December 2021." As of 2021, Healthlane had team strengths of 12 and 10 in Nigeria and Cameroon, respectively. It also had eight part-time staff across both countries. However, Nigerian and Cameroonian sources say that layoffs became common at Healthlane at the start of 2022.
In Cameroon, an employee was fired, and two others resigned due to the "terrible working conditions." The same conditions apparently made seven people resign in Nigeria after three were laid off. At the time of writing, sources indicate that including the co-founders, the company currently has only three employees in Nigeria and four in Cameroon. “Those who resigned were practically forced to do so. The strategy of management is to make you so useless that you would resign, and they will be exempt from any charges,” an employee claims. A document seen by Techpoint Africa reveals that the company fired all eight part-time staff. Building renovations and app update I earlier mentioned how Healthlane's app was not functioning on Android and curiously missing on the App Store. When I asked some of the company’s current and former employees why the app was not working, most of them said they had no idea. One of them suggested, “it’s possible that Alain owes Apple.”
Although Healthlane claims they “are currently making some changes to the app,” multiple sources confirm that the app hasn’t been functioning since September 2022. On November 9, 2022, in a bid to make sense of all these, I decided to reach out to some of Healthlane's investors. Interestingly, by the next day, the app's functionality on Android devices was suddenly restored. It also became available on the App Store. However, the appointment booking functionality was unavailable. “Alain is not a mobile developer. He must have contracted external developers to work on the app," says a former employee, "Meanwhile, he continues to owe his internal engineers and staff.” They also claim that Healthlane is only a company on paper because there is no product, “only a bunch of lies.” Healthlane’s Nigerian office was situated at 16 Adewale Kolawole Crescent, Lekki, Lagos State, Nigeria “until August 2022 when the company left the building. Rent expired on June 30, 2022.”
Consequently, an ex-employee maintains that “there are no on-going renovations by the company. Healthlane Nigeria officially has no office. The company belongings were packed into an employee's house, and employees found themselves working from home while waiting for the next vision.” Another adds, “Their most recent client was seen in July, so anything after that is merely posturing.” I visited the company’s facility in Lekki on a Tuesday morning to confirm this. The absence of Healthlane's signage was the first thing I noticed when I got there. One look at the structure and it was apparent it was empty. Following further investigation about the building, two different sources confirmed that no one was currently residing in the building. They also mentioned that the company had left two months prior. According to one of them, the landlord now owns the building.
I contacted our HMO provider to find out if they knew what was happening and if they were still in partnership with Healthlane. While they confirmed their partnership, they were unsure of Healthlane's current location. A source confirms that, “There is no ongoing renovation in Cameroon. I do not see what is there to renovate for operations not to be holding. They are even owing a lot of vendors and find it difficult to pay electric bills.” Another employee adds that the facility in Nigeria had to close in July due to the high facility maintenance cost, including rent, electricity, repairs, and generator and pool maintenance. After the closure, the staff were informed that a smaller temporary location would be rented. However, sometime later, they were told there would be no office and that Healthlane would instead focus on outsourcing the lab's services while carrying out its follow-up care strategies for chronic health conditions. But that was not the case in Cameroon. While the office was not closed, the “strategy changed from checkups and care plan to programme reversal and, most recently, to no activity.”
Consequently, no contract staff has been actively employed since October because no salaries have been paid since April 2022 in Cameroon. A 1.4-million-dollar question Having seen how Healthlane, which once had a great work culture, became toxic by failing to communicate with its employees, delaying and owing salaries, and erratically firing employees, one could somewhat guess the root cause. Healthlane raised a $2.4 million seed round in 2020 and began operations in August 2021. But as of May 2021, following a hiring process that began in March, the company had less than $1 million left. The $1.4-million-dollar question is, "What happened to $1.4 million before Healthlane began operations?" According to a source close to the matter, Healthlane does not have a board of directors. Nteff, the CEO, is "management" and the sole signatory to the company's accounts. “Before the company began operations, Nteff was already withdrawing substantial sums of money. There have been suspicious transactions indicating that the company has been diverting funds.”
Multiple sources also confirm that the CEO bought equipment without consulting employees. That led to spending money on equipment that wasn't necessary or needed by the company. For instance, he purchased four haematology analysers when the company already had two functional ones. “While these purchases are not useless, they were made without consulting the relevant team members and, thus, became idle on arrival,” a source claims. They also reveal how Nteff “hid for three months in Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos while his creditors sought him out in Cameroon and Nigeria." Though we couldn’t lay hold of hard evidence, sources say “Payhippo debt recovery agents unsuccessfully tried to find him at the office on multiple occasions.” Different documents show that Nteff used company funds for personal expenses, leaving him in debt to several vendors, including fintech apps offering loan services. You might recall that Healthlane was one of the 60 African startups selected for the second cohort of the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund (BFF) in September 2022. So, what happened to the funds? What now? According to a source, Nteff stopped coming to the office in Cameroon sometime in the second week of November 2022.
That came several weeks after Agbor stopped coming to the office. “Alain packed everything out of his office. He instructed the person keeping the office to pass on his office key to Reevy.” For context, Reevy, a Cameroonian company, was Healthlane’s nutrition partner in the country. According to a source, “there are rumours that Alain is planning to sell out the office to Reevy.” It means, “presently Reevy has taken over the office and is working on restarting operations.” However, “Alain still owns the technology aspect of the company.” Further, the source mentions that Reevy will operate as Healthlane in Cameroon for the next six months before changing the name altogether. According to them, “six months is enough time for Alain to keep fooling investors that the company is in operation so that he can raise a Series A.” Multiple sources claim that Nteff is looking to raise a Series A in 2023. “He's doing this, especially to pay his numerous debts," says one source, "That is why he would deny shutting down Healthlane.”
Another source also claims that they heard that Alain is looking for a partner to buy the clinical arm of Healthlane while he sticks with the telemedicine idea he pitched to investors. What’s more, a source, as of the time of writing, mentioned that the CEO sent screenshots to more than two staff in Nigeria that he has "wired about 3 months salaries to them that they should confirm it." They also mentioned that Nteff said he'd dissolve the Nigerian team. Consequently, "the company terminated two employees in Nigeria immediately they confirmed their payment." As of the time of writing, none of the staff in Cameroon had received their owed salaries. Techpoint Africa contacted CEO Nteff to confirm this and other details. Nteff responded saying that “Many of the statements are factually incorrect. However, because of an ongoing legal investigation into some illegal access of Healthlane files by journalists, we cannot provide any response before your deadline. At the conclusion of this investigation, we will be happy to issue a full statement."

Dear healthtech startup, Jumia is coming for your bread! On Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million. Even with this growth, it's not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021. Now to some good and potentially exciting developments. JumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.
PSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction’s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay’s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters. Healthcare at the drop of a hat Perhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia’s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1. Viewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030. Although little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.
Existing telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth’s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist. These companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa’s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers. Additionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately. The fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.
Building partnerships for effective healthcare While these could pose challenges to Jumia’s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route. In a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, “Jumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly. “This approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.” Unlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia. Healthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia.
Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia’s considerably larger customer base. An example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya’s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel’s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money. Despite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa’s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.

SeamlessHR, Gates Foundation Roll Out Earned Wage Access Solution for Workers in Nigeria Africa’s leading payroll and HR technology company, SeamlessHR, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, recently hosted the top echelon of employers of blue-collar workers in Nigeria in an exclusive event to discuss the optimisation of blue-collar employee welfare and productivity through a new technology solution, Breeze Payer.

Additionally, the platform helps wage earners build their credit history, which can facilitate access to larger loans with longer tenors and improve their overall financial well-being. Lynn Eisenhart, Deputy Director of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, who also spoke on how employee welfare impacts productivity, said, “Employees are our most valuable asset. People stay because of how organisations treat them and the benefits they enjoy during their stay. Blue-collar workers deserve to be empowered by financial services and empowered by their organisations so they can be more productive.
We want to give them access to financial resources at their fingertips through the Earned Wage Access platform.

Unleash Your Gaming Potential with Infinix NOTE 30's Innovative Bypass Charging Function For avid mobile gamers, gathering with friends for gaming sessions in popular titles like "Free Fire" or "Arena of Valor" serves as a way to unwind and alleviate daily stress. However, a common challenge arises when their phones run out of battery during gameplay and require charging to continue. This often leads to overheating issues with regular phone batteries, causing the gaming performance to suffer due to underclocking of the SoC chip. Fortunately, Infinix NOTE 30 addresses this concern with its bypass charging function, allowing players to charge while gaming without overheating. With the NOTE 30, gamers can enjoy an uninterrupted and cool gaming experience. The Infinix NOTE 30 introduces an impressive 45W wired fast charging feature, providing 1.95 hours of gaming battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. Additionally, it can charge up to 75% of the 5000mAh battery in just 30 minutes. A standout feature of the phone is its innovative bypass charging technology, which directly powers the motherboard while charging and playing games. This extends battery life, reduces battery aging, and enhances safety during charging and gameplay.
Technically, the bypass charging function is a smart feature of the NOTE 30. When the battery level reaches or surpasses the bypass charging threshold (default at 30%), the charging current bypasses the battery and goes directly to the motherboard. By implementing bypass charging, the phone significantly reduces overheating issues that commonly occur during simultaneous charging and gaming. In tests conducted by Infinix Lab, bypass charging reduced the temperature of the NOTE 30 by 2-7°C compared to conventional charging methods. This greatly improves user comfort, especially during extended gaming sessions or in hot weather conditions. Enabling bypass charging is simple and can be accessed through the X-Arena game space interface. Users can slide out the sidebar from the left or right sides of the screen and select bypass charging. Infinix is committed to providing users with more freedom and the latest innovations. With the new model, players can adjust the bypass charging threshold within the X-Arena settings to three options: 20%, 30%, or 40%. This empowers users to choose whether the current input directly supplies power to the motherboard instead of going through the battery when the battery reaches their desired threshold.
For an unparalleled gaming experience, the NOTE 30 series introduces the exclusive gaming software XArena. Driven by the advanced Dar-Link 2.0 engine, it intelligently optimizes the CPU and GPU speeds of the Helio G99 chipset, ensuring smooth gameplay and stunning visuals in every gaming scenario. XArena offers handy features such as call and message interference, along with Respawn Countdown, which keeps players informed about their in-game respawn time, allowing them to efficiently manage their tasks. Moreover, the NOTE 30 Pro takes gaming to the next level with its VC liquid cooling, flagship JBL sound, and immersive 120Hz screen, guaranteeing superior audio, touch, and visual experiences for passionate gamers. As summer heats up, the Infinix NOTE 30 becomes an indispensable companion for gamers, enabling uninterrupted gaming sessions without concerns of overheating. Dive into thrilling gameplay with your teammates throughout the day and indulge in the excitement of immersive gaming experiences all summer long! Infinix Note 30 series can be purchased at authorized retail outlets across Nigeria. Follow Infinix Nigeria on social media for more information about the Note 30 Series and its amazing features.

Leveraging Youth Power, Culture, and, The Creative Economy: The Key to Africa’s Future- Africa Soft Power The Wheatbaker, Victoria Island, Lagos, witnessed a momentous gathering of esteemed business leaders, Influential African creatives, policy makers, digital champions, and leading entrepreneurs from diverse industries last Friday. United by a shared vision, these exceptional individuals and bright minds convened to explore how Africa can secure its future by unlocking the power of its youth, culture, and the creative economy. Organized by Africa Soft Power in collaboration with the Ford Foundation, Open Society Foundations, and African Women on Board, the event focused on the intricate relationship between digital platforms, technology adoption, youth empowerment, and creative entrepreneurship. “As a country and as a continent, it is imperative to include young people and women in every leadership space. From #endsars, to #Congoisbleeding and other several social movements that the continent has witnessed in recent years, we have seen what happens when we do not provide the needed inclusion and security for women and young people '' highlighted Nkiru Balonwu, Founder and Creative Director of Africa Soft Power. “We will continue to have these conversations, shining the light on the immense opportunities that Africa's soft power, deeply rooted in its vibrant culture and youthful population, offers for growth. While the advent of digital media and advancements in technology are providing African youth with platforms to express their talents, shape their own narratives, and build successful careers across various industries, we remain committed to advancing conversations that will help the continent leverage this growth potential, ” Nkiru added. Even as the creative and knowledge industries offer immense opportunities for young Africans, there are still threats out there - and high on that list is insecurity. Security is an intersectional issue that affects everything from basic human rights, living standards, trade, prosperity, freedom of movement, access to education, gender equality, etc.
The absence of security is one of the factors limiting innovation and economic growth in many areas of the continent. The event featured a panel session, moderated by Folashade Anozie, Founder & CEO, Nonconform Productions. Panelists and experts on the session include; Njideka Agbo, Founder and CEO Glann Media Consult & Fmr. Editor, Guardian Life Magazine; Hon. Akintunde Oyebode, Commissioner of Finance & Economic Development, Ekiti State; Dr Seun Fakorede, Commissioner For Youth and Sports, Oyo State and Adaora Ikenze, Director, Public Policy, Anglophone West Africa at Meta “You can’t solve the problem of security where there is absence of fairness and justice” Says Hon Akintunde Oyebode, Commissioner of Finance & Economic Development, Ekiti State. “A big driver of crime is the absence of consequence, this is why you will find that in a society where there's an absence of consequence, people often gravitate towards crime. “The challenge of security in Nigeria is a hydra-headed problem, in some parts of the country, there's major kidnappings ongoing, in other parts, there is a drug problem, but at the heart of it all is a clear admission that state capacity has been waning for a while and has gotten to a point where it is simply incapable of responding to social issues” concludes Akintunde. With almost 60% of Africa's population under the age of 25, the continent proudly stands as the youngest on the planet. By 2050, its population is projected to double, positioning this surging youth demographic as Africa's biggest opportunity for growth, innovation, and sustainable development. Njideka Agbo, Founder and CEO Glann Media Consult & Fmr, Editor, Guardian Life Magazine, maintained that the lack of security and inclusion is responsible for the brain drain in Nigeria and parts of Africa. “At a time, people were excited to come back to Nigeria, but all that has changed.
In 2018, we were the 4th largest group of asylum seekers in the European Union, because more and more people keep moving out in search of greener pastures, more opportunities and better security. The level of patriotism that the youth show to their country is determined by the level of appreciation that they get from the Government, alongside the security and inclusion that the country provides for them, She added. Securing The Future: Youth Power, Culture & the Creative Economy was an important platform for both government stakeholders and young voices across several industries to engage each other. As global stakeholders rally behind Africa's ambition, it is imperative to acknowledge the fundamental role that youth power and the creative economy play in building a prosperous continent.

Cloudax Launches P2P Platform To Meet The Growing Cryptocurrencies Interests and Demands in Nigeria With Nigeria standing head and shoulder above the growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies in Africa, Cloudax, an innovative technology-driven ecosystem built for wholesome content creators and communities, is launching its P2P App and website to onboard Africans into the crypto ecosystem, meeting the surging needs and demands of first-time and all-time crypto users. Speaking about the piqued interest of Nigerians in the crypto space, the CEO of Cloudax, Olumuyiwa A, said “I think the quick adoption of cryptocurrency in Africa is largely driven by the difficulties the African youth faces in conducting borderless financial operations whilst living and working in the global village that the world has become. Digital currencies have become the easiest means to conduct financial transactions and it's encouraging to see that a number of African governments appear to be developing or on their way to developing regulations which promote the use of cryptocurrencies in their regions.” A 2022 report by Chainalysis revealed that P2P exchanges account for 6% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in Africa, more than double the share of the next-closest region, Central & Southern Asia and Oceania. This highlights the need for ramp providers to build bridges between the web3 and fiat ecosystems in Africa. He continued by saying “We are excited to introduce our P2P platform, which will bridge the gap between crypto enthusiasts and mainstream users in Nigeria. Our mission is to empower individuals with a seamless and affordable solution for crypto transactions. With asset security being the greatest concern of most users, CloudP2P gives the best customer experience with its extremely secure and user-friendly marketplace for swift and seamless buying, selling and swapping of crypto.” The Cloudp2p platform boasts several key features that sets it apart from existing P2P solutions in the market.
First, it provides a secure and reliable environment for users to buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies directly with one another, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This not only reduces transaction costs but also ensures faster settlement times. Cloudax has several other products in development, including a discount store and an infrastructure support wallet.

These virtual dollar cards can help you pay for international transactions from Nigeria Over the holidays, I had to get a new ATM card as the previous one was a few days away from expiring. But changing it came with a few challenges. Where I had previously paid for international subscriptions like YouTube with it, now I struggled. On Thursday, January 5, 2023, Zenith Bank informed its customers that it would be suspending international ATM withdrawals, web transactions, and PoS transactions conducted with its naira card from Monday, January 9, 2023. In doing so, it joined the list of Nigerian banks that have shuttered international transactions using naira cards. Since 2022, more Nigerian banks have either reduced the transaction limit for international transactions or completely shut them down as the CBN has attempted to stem the country's rising inflation. But alternatives, particularly virtual dollar cards, have emerged, with many Nigerians needing ways to pay for international transactions. Here are a few of these options. Disclaimer: All options on this list are recommendations and do not serve as endorsements.
Ensure you do your research before using any of them. Payday In 2021, fintech startup, Payday, announced that it had closed a pre-seed round of $1 million a few months after it started operations. The self-styled Pan-African startup provides a means for Africans within and outside the continent to send and receive money. By providing virtual accounts domiciled in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, its users can receive payments like locals, regardless of location. Users can also create a virtual dollar card that allows them to make purchases of up to $25,000 monthly. Getting the card is free, but users must be verified. Changera As the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has placed limits on how much Nigerians can transact, many have turned to cryptocurrencies to enable them to bypass these restrictions. Crypto startup, Bitmama built Changera in 2021 for this purpose.
Providing a virtual dollar card, Changera users can make online payments with the card. Other features include money transfers, currency conversion, and a virtual bank account. Unlike the other options on this list, Changera operates a freemium model for its cards. Users can choose a free plan, a freelancer plan for $50 annually, and a premium plan for $100 annually. Users on the free plan can create virtual cards but creating USD, GBP, CAD, or EUR virtual accounts is only available for users on the freelancer or premium plan. Chipper Cash Chipper Cash is one of the few African unicorns and was founded in 2014 by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled. Chipper Cash provides a virtual dollar card that users can use while shopping on platforms like Amazon or when paying for international subscriptions. Getting a virtual card first requires you to have a Chipper Cash account. You would also need to provide a means of identification, such as an international passport or national identity card.
Geegpay In the past five years, there has been an explosion of Nigerians living in Nigeria and working for companies outside the continent. But while it has become easier to get these jobs, receiving remuneration has not necessarily become more straightforward. Despite the increased options for receiving money from outside the continent, that remains a challenge. Geegpay is a product of Raenest targeted at gig workers in Africa. Using Geegpay, gig workers can receive payments and generate invoices. They also receive a USD account and a virtual dollar card. Getting the virtual dollar card costs $2 and can only occur after a user has completed all sign-up and verification processes. You’ll be required to provide details such as your employment offer, occupation, employer’s details, proof of address, and identity, so make sure you have them on hand. Nigerian startup, Raenest, wants to help Africans get hired and paid anywhere
ALAT Often referred to as Nigeria's first fully digital bank, ALAT is the fintech subsidiary of Wema Bank. Founded in 2017, ALAT provides a fully digital banking experience for its over 700,000 customers. Users on ALAT can create a new account in less than five minutes, enabling them to access loans and an automated savings platform. It also offers an array of cards facilitating local and international payments. Its dollar credit card and virtual dollar cards help its users make payments for subscriptions, including YouTube while paying for services on international websites. Eversend Eversend has provided virtual cards to users since 2020, enabling them to pay for services on platforms like Aliexpress, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Skillshare, and Namecheap. Creating a virtual card on Eversend is free, but users pay a $1 monthly maintenance fee. They also have to fund the card with $1, while multiple cards can be created.
Eversend virtual cards can be funded using bank transfers, mobile money, or debit/credit cards. Do you occasionally make international transactions? What payment methods do you use? Share in the comments section.

Cryptocurrency Day Trading: Tips and Techniques for Short-Term Profitability If it involves cryptocurrency, profits, and trade strategies, sign me up ASAP! And if you’re anything like me, I’m about to put you on cryptocurrency day trading. This is one of the most popular trading techniques, and with the right approach, you’ll also seamlessly trade for profit quickly. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned trader, there’s something for you to pick up in this guide. Ready to level up with cryptocurrency day trading? Let’s start with the basics. What is Cryptocurrency Day trading? Going Back To The Basics Day trading is not only applied to cryptocurrency.
It is a concept prevalent even in traditional trading like stocks, forex, and other commodities. Day trading literally means entering and exiting the market on the same day. Day trading came about from the stock market because trades were only open during business hours, so all transactions had to be completed within the day. You may hear “intraday trading” within this same context, but don’t worry; it is the same as day trading. With that being said, cryptocurrency day trading is purchasing and selling crypto assets within the same day, pulling profits due to the market's volatility. It is one of the most lucrative crypto ventures. Cryptocurrency day trading is one of the cases where the crypto market's volatile nature is used to maximum advantage. The rapid price fluctuations can be leveraged to raise profits for the traders — but it’s not a guessing game; that’s just gambling. With cryptocurrency day trading, it is important to move with winning strategies, which we’ll explore in a bit. The Steps To Day Trade Cryptocurrency: A Beginner’s Approach
Know The Market You can’t go into the market without a proper orientation. So, do the groundwork and educate yourself on cryptocurrencies, the technologies that drive them, and the factors that affect price fluctuations. For example, a utility crypto is more prone to fluctuations than a crypto that powers a decentralised application (DApp). Follow the industry experts, join crypto communities, and read expansively on the subject before committing. Choose an exchange You’ll need to choose an exchange where you can quickly move in and out of the market. Important considerations when choosing an exchange include the transaction fees, asset liquidity (i.e. how quickly you can convert to cash), and transaction processing time. If you’re a trader in Nigeria or Ghana, you can use some of the popular exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to buy.
However, to quickly exit the market and retain the crypto's value in cash, Breet is the best exchange to sell your crypto. Decide on a trading strategy. Cryptocurrency day trading is not about vibes and feelings. It is a calculated and strategic profit-making venture. Successful day traders have precise strategies, including entry and exit marks, stop-loss tactics, and risk-management plans. They also use technical tools to help them make informed decisions and maximise their efficiency, Here are the best strategies you can use to make profitable day trading The Best Strategies for Cryptocurrency Day Trading High-Frequency Trading (HFT) High-Frequency Trading is the use of trading bots to make lightning-fast trades.
It involves algorithms running analysis on the market, spotting the trends, and executing your trades effectively for quick profits. The market moves extremely fast, but sophisticated bots can match its speed and catch trends that may appear and disappear in seconds. Due to the advancement of tech tools, HFT has become a popular day trading strategy. HFT automates trading as it completes a trade when it meets the trader's set conditions. HFT leverages arbitrage to make short-term profits. Arbitrage is buying a crypto asset on one platform and selling on another to leverage the slight price difference for extra gains. High-frequency trading is a favourite because it keeps liquidity flowing in the market and connects buyers and sellers quickly, thus, ensuring stability. The algorithm on which HFT is built also allows traders to maximize their profits as transactions execute based on the pre-set price of the traders. Scalping Scalping is used when traders dump a high volume of assets in the market but take advantage of the small price movements in the market rather than large jumps.
The idea is to gather small profits over the course of the day for a significant return at the end of the day. In scalping, the coin of interest usually has high market volume and liquidity, like Bitcoin, due to constant price movements. To maximise profit, scalpers create their own demand and supply by buying at a bid price but selling at the asking price. Scalping favours technical analysis over fundamental techniques, so traders who rely on this method know the crypto ecosystem's inner workings and can thrive even under pressure. Scalping can also be automated using trading bots to find trending and profitable trades. Additionally, due to the significant liquidity, a stop-loss order is non-negotiable. So, it is not recommended for beginners. Range Trading Usually, crypto prices are always contained within a range. It goes from stable highs to stable lows, indicated on the support and resistance lines.
Whenever it goes above or below that range, it is indicative of an abnormal change. Range traders use this method to determine the best time to buy or sell their assets. On the support levels, the crypto’s price will be unable to break through to decrease. While on the resistance level, the crypto price will meet a barrier that stops it from increasing. So, if a price is closer to the support level, that’s probably the best time to enter the market and exit when the price is inching closer to the resistance levels. The Risks Of Cryptocurrency Day Trading Cryptocurrency day trading may be lucrative. However, it comes with its own cautions, and the results may be dire if you don’t take note of these risks attached to crypto day trading. Volatility The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its unstable and unpredictable price movements.
One coin may be soaring one day and come crashing down the next day. So, if you’re a beginner in the crypto market, you may have a hard time dealing with this reality. But seasoned traders know how it is and can even use different strategies to play it to their advantage. Vague Assessment The long-term performance of cryptocurrencies isn’t very defined. Unlike the stock market, which has business plans and defined financial progressions based on their performance in the market, crypto doesn’t have that. Even coins with actual uses in the digital world still present the challenge of analyzing their long-term financial projections — making it difficult to predict their value. With the crypto market, what you see is what you get. No Defined Regulations Some may praise crypto for this, while others are wary of crypto because of this.
Clearly, this is a matter of perspective. The lack of central authority does give people autonomy over their money and allows them to conduct business however they deem fit. In the same vein, it may be the playground for many malicious individuals who may go scot-free with no law demanding their prosecution. But we’ve seen different developments in different countries figuring out how to regulate crypto. The US, for example, is actively attempting this with various policies, while countries like El Salvador have completely embraced Bitcoin as a legal tender. So – it’s different strokes for different folks. But even as we continually see regulations in the crypto space, you’re ultimately in charge of your own security and asset management. Conclusion. Cryptocurrency day trading is very lucrative and convenient, and with proper education on these strategies: High-Frequency Trading, Scalping, or Range Trading, you’ll record trading success. Keep in mind that the crypto market moves very fast, so you have to move as fast as it does.
And when it’s time to recover your profits, you can trust Breet for the best exchange rate without losing any value in cash. Crypto-to-cash with Breet is so seamless —you barely have to lift a finger with the Automatic Settlement feature, and that sends your cash straight to your bank account in Nigeria or Ghana! Best of luck as you explore these crypto trade secrets for profit within the same day. Happy trading!

InDrive Announces Extension of its Name-Your-Price Model to 15 additional Nigerian cities and launches innovative freight services Bolsters Operations with Zero-Commission Offer for Drivers in 15 New Cities On Friday, July 14, inDrive, the globally recognized mobility and urban services platform, revealed plans to extend its peer-to-peer ride-hailing service to 15 new Nigerian cities and to launch a freight product feature called, inDrive.Freight. The announcement was made at the Lagos Startup Week 2023, which celebrates entrepreneurship and innovation in Africa. Timothy Oladimeji, Business Development Representative, inDrive Nigeria, described mobility as a basic need that every human must have and stressed how the 15-city extension by inDrive makes this very easy for everyone in local communities through its fair and transparent peer-to-peer ride-hailing model. Further speaking to the launch of the logistics-support product for small, medium, and large enterprises, Oladimeji said, “From data analyzed, we realized that people wanted a courier service that could help them transport packages that weigh more than 20kg. Hence, we introduced an upgraded version of our courier service - inDrive.Freight - an on-demand, same-day delivery service which allows our customers and other business owners to transport goods weighing between 20kg to 20tn, seamlessly.” The Business Development Representative went on to explain that the inDrive.Freight module mirrors that of the peer-to-peer ride-hailing app features, that allow customers to set preferable prices, choose vehicles, and select drivers. It also showcases a unique feature that allows customers to take a picture of goods that they intend to send. For business owners, this has a transformative impact as the business owners no longer have to invest capital in setting up their own courier services or adjunct logistics businesses, with cost-saving alternatives offered through the usage of the inDrive.Freight.
Going live with the launch across Nigeria, on Monday, July 18, inDrive's expansion to the new 15 cities in Nigeria has officially commenced.
